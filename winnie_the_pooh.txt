C           D       G    G#dim
Deep in the hundred acre wood 
      C           D     G  (Gmaj7)  G#dim 
Where Christopher Robin plays,
       C          D       G   (D) Em
You'll find the enchanted neighborhood
   C             D         G
Of Christopher's childhood days.

  C            D      G      G#dim
A donkey named Eeyore is his friend
    C         D      G  (Gmaj7)  G#dim 
And Kanga and little Roo.
        C          D      G  (D)      Em
There's Rabbit and Piglet and there's Owl, 
    C           D          G    (Gadd5  G6  G7)
But most of all Winnie the Pooh.

D          Dsus2  Gmaj7      G6    
Winnie the Pooh.  Winnie the Pooh. 
D(7)                   G       Gmaj7  G6     G7
Tubby little cubby all stuffed with   fluff, He's...
D          Dsus2  Gmaj7      G6    
Winnie the Pooh.  Winnie the Pooh. 
D           D7        G
Willy nilly silly old bear.

(Repeat chorus)
