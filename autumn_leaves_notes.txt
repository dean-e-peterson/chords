Autumn Leaves Notes

 * Co7 is a substitute for the B7 chord in the "sheet music"; feel free
   to interchange Co7 & B7 in tune [Co7 = B7b9(no root)].

     In fact, the chords above can be viewed as a simple example of
 jazz substitutions--

 A section, "sheet music":    Am   D7   G   G   Am   B7   Em     Em
 "    "     "jazz chords":    Am7  Am6  GM7 GM6 Am7  Co7  Em     Em

 --the WHY's:
   1) Am-->Am7: in most cases, you can play a m7 for a minor to get a
     "jazzier" sound (Santana & Steely Dan did it all the time--likewise,
     in this tune, you could change all the Em's to Em7's...). Another
     common jazz substitution "line" for the plain minor chord could also
     be incorporated into this song: instead of Em  Em, try Em(//)
     Em(M7) (//) Em7(//) Em6 (//).
   2) D7-->Am6: for a V7 chord in a major tonality (here, D7, in G major),
     you can substitute the V9 (D7->D9); in addition, D9(no root)=Am6
     [V9(no root)=ii6]; therefore, D7 becomes...Am6!, which follows
     nicely, voice-leading-wise after the Am7.... ("IT's not MAG-ic....")
   3) G-->GM7-M6: for the I (major tonic or "key") chord, especially
     long stretches thereof, the M7, M6, or both! can be played in lieu
     of the boring plain major chord (though the M7 & M6 would sound
     pretty weird in a country or folk progression!)....
   4) B7-->Co7: see *note above; indeed, most diminished seventh chords
     you'll see can be explained as substitutes for some dominant
     seventh-type chord....

 LEAD notes: I'd tab out the schmaltzy melody, but the reason this
     song is still being recorded by jazz people to this day is that
     it's a fun tune to improvise over (and by the way, only the Lord
     knows why anyone would still want to sing the corny words!).
   Since this song doesn't modulate (unless you count GM<->Em, but not
     really) it's a lot easier to jam over than most "jazz standards."
     In fact, you only need TWO scales:

   1. E natural (aeolian) minor (=G major!) scale: e-f#-g-a-b-c-d-e
       --this'll fit all the chords except the B7 & Co7....
   2. E harmonic minor scale: e-f#-g-a-b-c-*d#*-e
       --this'll fit over the B7 & Co7 chords: notice that the only
          difference from the first scale is the d#--in fact, it's
          actually easier to just think "d# instead of d" when you
          come to these chords than to worry about "harmonic instead of
          natural minor! oh, no!...."
   {3. For a little spice, try a diminished 7th arpeggio over the Co7 &
          B7 chords: c-d#-f#-a (true, these tones are in the harmonic
          minor scale given above--just a slightly different approach):

          ______ --try playin' from low to high and back, then experiment
       I  ||1|||  on your own--right, just every three frets in any
          |||1|1  direction!...
          |3||||
          ||4|3|
          |||4|4
          ||||||

   --Now lay down the rhythm track, and go fer it--

 FINALLY, the "sound" of these chords (and associated scales) does
   take a lot of getting used to--even after you get the rather
   difficult fingerings down (took me months), there's still the
   matter of acclimating your ears to actually _liking_ the sound of,
   say, a M6/9b5 chord (took me years!). But if the plain old G-C-D
   stuff is gettin' yu' down, and you also realize you'll never be
   a great speed-metal lead picker--well, this is one logical direction
   of development. . . . Oh, a M6/9b5? :: CM6/9b5: - 3 2 2 3 2 .
   "Beautiful-ugly," ain't it?!

And from jazztheorylessons.com...

Autumn Leaves is a classic jazz standard that everyone will come across at some
point. This is one of the most popular jazz standards of all time and it is
typically one of the first standards people learn to play. The song itself
follows a simple 32 bar AB structure. The song features both a major and minor
2 5 1 progression and offers you a fairly gentle introduction into the world of
jazz improvisation.  Have a listen to this great version of Autumn leaves with
Keith Jarrent on piano. It should help you get a feel for the sound of this
tune.

Let’s take a look at the autumn leaves chord progression.
[Dean's note: Found many chords that looked something like these]
A section (16 bars)
Cmin7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Ebmaj7
Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7
Cmin7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Ebmaj7
Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7
B section (16 bars)
Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7
Cmin7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Ebmaj7
Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | C9
Eb9 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7

As you can see the tune can be divided up into two sections. The first eight
bars of the A section are repeated making it easy to remember. The first four
bars of the A section are a major 2 5 1 4 progression in the key of Bb and bars
5 to 8 are a minor 2 5 1 progression in Gm.

I will use this lesson to show you the easiest way to play over this chord
progression, breaking each section down into the appropriate scale choice.
Let’s start by taking a look at the first 4 bars of this song.

Cmin7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Ebmaj7

If you know your theory, you should spot that all of the chords in the first
four bars are taken from the Bb major scale. In fact most of this tune is based
on the Bb major scale.

The chords of the Bb major scale are:

Bbmaj7 Cm7 Dm7 Ebmaj7 F7 Gm7 Am7b5

As you can see most of the chords in autumn leaves are taken from the Bb major
scale and so we can use Bb major to improvise over a lot of this tune. We can
improvise using the Bb major scale over all of the chords in the first four
bars. Like I mentioned, this is the easiest way to play over the progression.
You can think in terms of arpeggios or modes if you like but I find it easier
to think of this as being just four bars of Bb major scale.

The next four bars are slightly trickier due to the presence of the D7b9 chord.
The easiest way to play over this part of the song would be to use the G
harmonic minor scale over the first two bars and then revert back to the Bb
major scale for the bars 7 and 8. Playing the G harmonic minor scale over the
D7b9 chord yields the D phrygian dominant mode which brings out the b9 sound
nicely.

Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7

The only tricky part is the B section is the turnaround which looks like this:

Am7b5 | D7b9 | Gm7 | C9

Eb9 | D7b9 | Gm7 | Gm7

The only two chords that we have yet to cover are the C9 chord in bar 28 and
the Eb9 chord in bar 29. The easiest way to play over a dominant 9 chord is to
use either the mixolydian scale or the dominant 7 arpeggio. You can play C
mixolydian over the C9 chord and Eb mixolydian over the Eb9 chord.

Once you have mastered playing over the autumn leaves chord progression using
the simplest scale choices then you can start to experiment with chord tones
and arpeggios to bring out the sound of the progression even more. I will
expand on this idea more in a future lesson and look at more ways to play over
the autumn leaves chord progression. Good luck and enjoy this great jazz
standard.
