   C
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,
                          (Cmaj7)     F6
to ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
   C
To work in the service of life and living,
                                        F6
In search of the answers of questions unknown
      C
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,
                          Gm(7)
Part of beginning to understand,


(Chorus)
F               C
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    F                  C
The things that you've shown us,
    G           C
The stories you tell,
F              C
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    F            C             G           C
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       G     F   C
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...

         C
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you,
                             (Cmaj7)     F6
To light up the darkness and show us the way,
    C
For though we are strangers in your silent world,
                                           F6
To live on the land we must learn from the sea,
      C
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell,
                                Gm(7)
Joyful and loving in letting it be,


(Chorus)
F               C
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    F                  C
The things that you've shown us,
    G           C
The stories you tell,
F              C
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    F            C             G           C
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       G     F   C
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...
