Lavender's Blue
 - English folk song & nursery rhyme, recorded by Burl Ives, 3/4 ~136bpm, G2-G3
 - I changed genders, e.g.:  When you are king, dilly dilly, I'll be your queen,
              I changed to:  When I am king, dilly dilly, you'll be my queen,
 - I changed 'that told me so' to 'it told me so', just to live on the edge.
 - I picked my favorite verses and even combined two verses, but I tried to
   keep every third verse similiar in structure, like I saw in this version:

G          G7                 C          G
Lavender's blue, dilly dilly, lavender's green,
C         G                  Am(7)        D7sus4  D7sus2  D7
When I am king, dilly dilly, you'll be my queen,
G            G7                C            G
Who told you so, dilly, dilly, who told you so?

'Twas my own heart, dilly, dilly, it told me so.



I love to dance, dilly, dilly, I love to sing;
When you are queen, dilly, dilly, I will be king.
Lavender's green, dilly dilly, Lavender's blue.
You'll be my queen, dilly dilly, when I wed you.

Send for your men, dilly dilly, set them to hoe,
Set them to reap, dilly dilly, set them to mow,
Some to cut hay, dilly dilly, some to cut corn,
While you and I, dilly dilly, keep ourselves warm.

Lavender's blue, dilly dilly, lavender's green,
When I am king, dilly dilly, you'll be my queen,
Who told me so, dilly dilly, how can I know?
I told myself, dilly dilly, love told me so.



Wedding's for life, dilly dilly, love is to share,
And love must grow, dilly dilly, with joy and care.
Lavender's green, dilly dilly, Lavender's blue.
You'll be my queen, dilly dilly, when I wed you.

If you love me, dilly dilly, never to roam,
If I love you, dilly dilly, babies must come.
Pink for a girl, dilly dilly, blue for a boy,
Binding us close, dilly dilly, bringing us joy.

    Lavender's blue, dilly dilly, lavender's green,        (skip indented lines
    When I am king, dilly dilly, you'll be my queen,        for a shorter song)
    Who told me so, dilly dilly, how can I know?
    I told myself, dilly dilly, love told me so.



    Close we will live, dilly dilly, and when we die,
    Both in one grave, dilly dilly, close we will lie,
    Lavender's green, dilly dilly, Lavender's blue.
    You'll be my queen, dilly dilly, when I wed you.

    If I die first, dilly dilly, and that may be,
    You must live on, dilly dilly, thinking of me.
    If you die first, dilly dilly, maybe you will,
    I will live on, dilly dilly, loving you still.

Lavender's blue, dilly dilly, lavender's green,
When I am king, dilly dilly, you'll be my queen,
Who told you so, dilly, dilly, who told you so?
'Twas my own heart, dilly, dilly, it told me so.
