Intro: (Gadd5  G6  Gadd5  Gsus4)  G  C  (Cadd9  C  Cmaj7)
       Am  Gadd5  G  D7  G  (Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G)

Verse:
G       C      G                Bm              C
An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
Am                       Em                     Am                 C  D
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none.
G           C        G                 Bm       C
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
       Am           Em            Am    D7    G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay.

G       C      G        Bm             C
A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate;
Am               Em                    Am             C  D
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait.
G             C            G             Bm                C
He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring velvet hand,
Am                  Em                      Am       D7   G
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand.

Chorus:
C                 G (Bm?)               C                G
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old,
        Am                    Em                 Am            Dadd9  D
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul.
C                  G (Bm?)         C           G
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
    Am            Em            Am     D7     G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band.


G            C          G                   Bm            C
My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call.
Am             Em        Am           C  D
One went to Chicago, the other to St. Paul
G          C   G             Bm            C
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Am              Em               Am      D7      G
Living out this life I chose and come to know so well.

Musical interlude: (Gadd5  G6  Gadd5  Gsus4)  G  C  (Cadd9  C  Cmaj7)
                   Am  Gadd5  G  D7  G  (Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G)

G           C       G              Bm             C
I thank you for the music and your stories of the road.
Am                  Em              Am              C  D
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go.
G           C       G                Bm                 C
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough,
Am               Em               Am        D7    G
And Papa I don't think I said, "I love you" near enough.

(Chorus followed by ending: )
   .               Am              Em           Am     C  D       G
   .             I am the living  legacy to the leader of    the band
   .                            (C/G)  G  (C/G)  G  (C/G)  G  G7 C Am Em D7 G
