A             Adim    A        A6 E7
I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day,
                                  E    Adim    A
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray;
C#7              F#m               B7             E     E7
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams,
F#m  Am      E        C#7    F#7  B7   E  E7
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you.

CHORUS:
A     (Adim)    (A)           Adim (A) D    F#7  B7
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm  in  love with you.
E7                      (Ab)     A    Bbdim  E  E7
Let me hear you whisper that you love me     too.
A       (Adim)     (A)      Adim (A)  D    F#7  B(7)
Keep the love-light glowing in   your eyes so   true.
D      Adim      A            D      B7   E7   A
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you.

A               Adim    A           A6  E7
Longing for you all the while, More and more;
                             E  Adim  A
Longing for the sunny smile, I  a  -  dore;
C#7               F#m           B7             E    E7
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
F#m   Am       E         C#7    F#7  B7   E  E7
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you.
