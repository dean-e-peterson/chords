VERSE:
    C(add5)     Am7      G                   Am7
    Hush now my Storeen, close your eyes and sleep
    C(add5)      Am7    G
    Waltzing the waves, diving the deep
    C(add5)           Am7         G              F
    Stars are shining bright, the wind is on the rise
    C(add5)    Am7      G              C(add5)
    Whispering words of long-lost lullabies

CHORUS:
                  F         C                            G
    Oh, won't you come with me where the moon is made of gold?
               F       C   G
    And in the morning sun we'll be sailing
   (Em)           F         C                            G
    Oh, won't you come with me where the ocean meets the sky?
   (Em)        F           C        G                    C
    And as the clouds roll by we'll sing the song of the sea

VERSE:
      C                Am7       G                  Am7
    I had a dream last night and heard the sweetest sound
      C                 Am7       G
    I saw a great white light and dancers in the round
    C              Am7   G              F
    Castles in the sand, cradles in the trees
    C               G              C
    Don't cry, I'll see you by and by

CHORUS:
                  F         C                            G
    Oh, won't you come with me where the moon is made of gold?
               F       C   G
    And in the morning sun we'll be sailing
   (Em)           F         C                            G
    Oh, won't you come with me where the ocean meets the sky?
   (Em)        F           C        G                    C
    And as the clouds roll by we'll sing the song of the sea
