Intro: A A+ A A+

A                           D             E
This year has been a little crazy for the Andersons.
A                          D            E
You may recall we had some trouble last year.
A                        D              E
The robot council had us banished to an asteroid.
A                          D       E
That hasn't undermined our holiday cheer.
       F#m              F#m6             F#m7                 F#m6
And we know it's almost Christmas by the marks we make on the wall.
           E        D       E
That's our favorite time of year.

(Chorus)
      A              Asus4       F#m
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime,
            G5/D         F#m                Bm
Where we're working in a mine for our robot overlords
          B                        E
Did I say overlords? I meant protectors.
      D              Dm          A      A+ A A+
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime.

Repeat Intro: A A+ A A+
A                         D           E
On every corner there's a giant metal Santa Claus,
A                        D           E
who watches over us with glowing red eyes.
A                           D                   E
They carry weapons and they know if you've been bad or good.
A                        D        E
Not everybody's good but everyone tries.
        F#m               F#m6          F#m7            F#m6
And the rocks outside the airlock exude ammonia-scented snow.
              E      D     E
It's (like) a Winter Wonderland.

(Chorus)

Repeat Intro: A A+ A A+
A                               D                E
That's all the family news that we're allowed to talk about.
A                              D        E
We really hope you'll come and visit us soon.
A                      D              E
I mean we're literally begging you to visit us.
A                               D           E
And make it quick before they [MESSAGE REDACTED].
         F#m                F#m6                 F#m7             F#m6
Now it's time for Christmas dinner - I think the robots sent us a pie!
           E       D       E
You know I love my soylent green.

(Chorus)

(Alternate words to 2nd verse)
They tried to decorate and make it look more Christmassy,
but what they did was more like Christmas in hell.
They nailed a Santa to a cross in front of everyone,
It wasn't pleasant but I'm sure they meant well.
And the rocks outside the airlock exude ammonia-scented snow.
It's like a Winter Wonderland.
