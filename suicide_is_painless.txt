Intro: Bm Bsus4  Bm Bsus2  Bm Bsus4  Bm Bsus2

        Em7           A7
Through early morning fog I see
D              Bm
Visions of the things to be,
    Em                 A(7sus4) A7
The pains that are withheld for me,
  D                 Bm7 F#m7 B7
I realize and I can see,

CHORUS:
     Em7        A7
That Suicide is Painless.
   D              Bm7
It brings on many changes,                       
    Gmaj7 D/F#    Em       A(7) Bm   (at end:  Gmaj7  D/F#  Em  A7  Bm  Em  Bm)
And I can take or leave it if I please.


Try to find a way to make
All our little joys relate
Without that ever present hate,
But now I know that it's too late.
And (chorus)

The game of life is hard to play.
I'm going to lose it anyway.
The losing card I'll someday lay.
So this is all I have to say,
That (chorus)

The only way to win is cheat,
And lay it down before I'm beat.
And to another give a seat,
For that's the only painless feat.
'Cause (chorus)

The sword of time will pierce our skins,
It doesn't hurt when it begins.
But as it works it's way on in,
The pain grow stronger, watch it grin.
For (chorus)

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key,
Is it to be or not to be,
And I replied "Oh why ask me?"
Cause (chorus)
And you can do the same thing if you please.
