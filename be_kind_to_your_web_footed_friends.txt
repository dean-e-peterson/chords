   C
Be kind to your web-footed friends
                                G7
For that duck may be somebody's mother,
    
She lives in a nest in a swamp
          C          F      G
Where the weather is always damp.

    C
You may think that this is the end,
        E          E7              Am
Well it is, but to prove we're all liars,
      G#                C
We're going to sing it again,
                                   C  G
Only this time we'll sing a little higher.

[Repeat the song but sing it a bit higher.
 Continue for as many rounds as you can stand.
 Finally, end with this...]

You may think that this is the end....
Well you're right!
