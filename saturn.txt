Intro:  F   G/F   Em   F/Eb (or F7)   Dm   Gsus4  G  C

F                G/F
Packing my bags, going away,
Em                   Am (Em Am)
To a place where the air is clean.
   Dm                   G                             C  (Cadd9 C Cmaj7 C)
On Saturn -- there's no sense to sit and watch people die.
F                           G/F
We don't fight our wars the way you do;
Em                  Am    (Em Am)
We put back all the things we use.
   Dm                   G                           C
On Saturn -- there's no sense to keep on doing such crimes.

C                        Fmaj7
There's no principles in what you say,
G#                  F#
No direction in the things you do,
         Fm       Ebm               Fm/C
For your world is soon to come to a close.
C                          Fmaj7
Through the ages all great men have taught
G#                       F#
Truth and happiness just can't be bought...
   Fm            Ebm                   Fm/C  C
Or sold, tell me why are you people so cold.   I'm...


F                              G/F
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Em                      Am (Em Am)
Rainbow, moonbeams, and orange snow
   Dm               G                          C   (Cadd9 C Cmaj7 C)
On Saturn -- people live to be two hundred and five.
F                              G/F
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Em                          Am     (Em Am)
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
   Dm                G                         C
On Saturn -- just to live to us is our natural high.


C                      Fmaj7
We have come here many times before,
G#                       F#
To find your strategy to peace is war,
        Fm                                          Ebm                          Fm/C
Killing helpless men, women and children that don't even know what they're dying for.
C                           Fmaj7
We can't trust you when you take a stand
G#                   F#
With a gun and bible in your hand,
        Fm                                  Ebm                             Fm/C  C
And the cold expression on your face saying give us what we want or we'll destroy.  I'm...


F                              G/F
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Em                      Am (Em Am)
Rainbow, moonbeams, and orange snow
   Dm               G                          C   (Cadd9 C Cmaj7 C)
On Saturn -- people live to be two hundred and five.
F                              G/F
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Em                          Am     (Em Am)
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
   Dm                G                         C    (F  G/F  Em  F/Eb  Dm  Gsus4  G  C)
On Saturn -- just to live to us is our natural high.
