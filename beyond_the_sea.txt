    C (riff) Dm7   G        C (riff)
Somewhere        beyond the sea,
    Dm7   G           C
Somewhere waiting for me,
G        C         Em     F A7 Dm
My lover stands on golden sands
    G           C (riff)      D7 G7  C (riff) D7 G7
And watches the ships that go sail - ing.

    C (riff) Dm7   G        C (riff)
Somewhere        beyond the sea
      Dm7   G            C
She's there watching for me.
G          C        Em       F A7 Dm
If I could fly like birds on high
     G               C (riff)    D7 G7  C (riff) D7 B7
Then straight to her arms I'd go sail - ing

     E C#m A6   B7       E C#m
It's far      beyond the star,
     A6   B7         E    D
It's near beyond the moon.
  G Em C   D      G     Em
I know   beyond a doubt
   C    D     G                 (G G6 G) G7
My heart will lead me there soon

      C       Em         Dm7     G        C (riff)
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
      Dm7  G       C
We'll kiss just as before
      G           C    Em       F A7 Dm
(And) Happy we'll be beyond the sea
    G      C (riff)     D7 G7  C (riff) D7 G7
and never again I'll go sail - ing

My heart will lead me there soon

      E       C#m         A6     B7       E C#m
We'll meet, I know, we'll meet beyond the shore

We'll kiss just as before

(And) Happy we'll be beyond the sea

No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing, no more sailing
Good-bye, farewell my friend, no more sailing
So long sailing, no more sailing
No more, farewell...
No more sailing
