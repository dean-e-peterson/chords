Intro: E  E  E  E7

E7         E
Well there was a little falter at the alter of confession,
                       D  A     E7 
Down on its knees true love did fall.
      E 
After 31 days of sleepless nights,

She woke up to end it all.
     A               E
With I love you on a fresh tattoo
  B               E
Engraved upon his chest.
    C#m      (E)        B       E
She took her name right off his heart
G            A    E
So here's to the unblessed.


CHORUS:
   A        E         B      E
Oh love, oh love, you fickle thing,
     A      E         B      E
Such pretty words and golden rings.
(G#m)    C#m                B        E
It was a broken dream right from the start,
A           E        B       E
Bless their tortured tangled hearts.

G   A          E    G          A          E    E7
Hoo hoo hoo-oo-hoo. Hoo hoo-oo hoo hoo-oo-hoo. 


E7     E
Well a blast of confusion, coupled with delusion
                          D     A   E7
Makes the best made plans sometimes fail.
     E
They wined and they dined, had peace of mind,

She bought a gown and he rented tails.
        A               E
But the mighty cloud of destiny
     B                    E
Came drifting through the gates,
C#m    (E)     B          E
Busted up what could have been
G         A        E
A perfect hopeless case.


CHORUS (2x)

G   A          E    G          A         E    
Hoo hoo hoo-oo-hoo. Hoo hoo-oo hoo-oo-oo-hoo. 
G   D   A              G   D   E         
Hoo hoo hoo-oo-oo-hoo. Hoo hoo Hoo-oooo.
