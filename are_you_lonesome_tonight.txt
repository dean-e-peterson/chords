(G7)    C          Em/B          Am       (Am/G)
Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight?
        C        C7       F
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
          G7
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day,    (summer day?)
                                      C
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
       C7                         F
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
       D                         G          G7
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
        C                 Em             D
Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?
         Dm (or F)     G7         C    G7
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight.


[Spoken under verse chords:]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight.
You know someone said that the world is a stage, and you must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart.
Act One was when I met you.  I loved you at first glance.
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue.
Then came Act Two, you seemed to change and you acted strange,
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me, & I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies, than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around.
And if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down.


[sung:]
        C                 Em/B          D
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
         Dm (or F)     G7         C
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?
