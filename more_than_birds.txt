More Than Birds
- by Tim Blais of YouTube channel acapellascience
- Parody Lyrics for song More Than Words by Extreme
- Sorry about the lack of chords yet, I learned More Than Words approximately
  from some tablature long ago.

[Verse 1]
Pigeons and doves coo
They're not two birds but one from a deeper view
With life that always holds true
One descent but if you only knew
How clearly
Gulls and geese have had their roots revealed

[Chorus]
More than birds
The fossils have the clues to make it real
By the mid-Jurassic they had warm bodies
And hollow airy bones

[Bridge 1]
What would you do
If raptors grew wings and flew
More than birds the stones reveal
Archaeopteryx is real
What would you say
If I told you birds convey
More than eggs and tasty stew
They're a strain of dino too

[Verse 2]
How could life give rise to
Cockatoos from such a monstrous plan
Selection pressure substitutes their
Jumps for glides
To powered flight it tends
Adapting or T-Rex's feathers and wishbone

[Chorus]
More than birds
By oviraptor's breeding can be shown
Cause like birds they laid their eggs sequentially
And sat on them to grow

[Bridge 2]
What would you do
If you died while stuck in goo?
More than birds in amber sealed
Dino plumage is revealed
What would you say
If our rooks and birds of prey
Are the ancient kings made new
Cause they're avian dinos too

[Outro]
More than birds
