     Bm                        A              Bm                A
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip,
     Bm                A              G          A    Bm
That started from this tropic port, a-board this tiny ship.

     Cm               Bb               Cm                Bb
The mate was a mighty sailin' man, the skipper brave and sure,
     Cm             Bb                  G#    Bb   Cm
Five passengers set sail that day for a three hour tour,
  G#    Bb   Cm
A three hour tour.


    C#m             B                  C#m           B
The weather started getting rough, the tiny ship was tossed,
   C#m                        B                  A      B        C#m
If not for the courage of the fearless crew, the minnow would be lost,
    A      B        C#m
The Minnow would be lost.

    Dm                     C             Dm               C
The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle,
     Dm            C                Dm                 C
With Gilligan, the Skipper too, the Millionaire and his wife,
    Dm     C         Dm            C         Dm      C    Am    D
The mo-vie star, the professor and Mary Ann, here on Gilligan's Isle.


    Bm                    A                  Bm                    A
So, this is a tale of our castaways, they're here for a long, long time.
        Bm               A               G       A      Bm
They'll have to make the best of things, it's an uphill climb.

    Cm                 Bb               Cm            Bb
The first mate and his skipper too will do their very best
   Cm              Bb                 G#     Bb     Cm
To make the others comfortable in the tropic island nest.


   C#m                   B                C#m          B
No phone - no lights, no motorcars, not a single lux - ury,
          C#m      B             A        B      C#m
Just like Robinson Crusoe, it's primitive as can be.

   Dm                C                      Dm            C
So join us here each week my friend, You're sure to get a smile,
     Dm             C          Dm      C    Am    D
From seven stranded castaways, here on Gilligan's Isle.
