G             Gdim    G        G6 D7
I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day,
                                  D    Gdim    G
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray;
B7               Em                A7             D     D7
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams,
Em   Gm      D        B7     E7   A7   D  D7
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you.

CHORUS:
G     (Gdim)    (G)           Gdim (G) C    E7   A(7)
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm  in  love with you.
D7                      (F#)     G    G#dim  D  D7
Let me hear you whisper that you love me     too.
G       (Gdim)     (G)      Gdim (G)  C    E7   A(7)
Keep the love-light glowing in   your eyes so   true.
C      Gdim      G            C      A7   D7   G
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you.

G               Gdim    G           G6  D7
Longing for you all the while, More and more;
                             D  Gdim  G
Longing for the sunny smile, I  a  -  dore;
B7                Em            A7             D    D7
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
Em    Gm       D         B7     E7   A7   D  D7
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you.

CHORUS
