G                 D
I can't stand to fly;
Em             C
I'm not that naive.
G                D
I'm just out to find
    Em              C
The better part of me.
                 G                       D
I'm more than a bird...I'm more that a plane,
               Em            C
More than some pretty face beside a train.
         G       D  C  D  G
It's not easy to be me.

G                  D
Wish that I could cry,
Em           C
Fall upon my knees,
G              D
Find a way to lie
        Em              C
About a home I'll never see.
               G                     D
It may sound absurd...but don't be naive,
     Em              C
Even heroes have the right to bleed.
            G                         D
I may be disturbed...but won't you concede,
     Em              C
Even heroes have the right to dream.
         G       D  C  D
It's not easy to be me.

Em     D G      C        Em
Up, up ahead...away from me,
         A               Em                A
It's all right...you can all sleep sound tonight.
        C (Cmaj7 C)            D (Dsus4 Dadd5)
I'm not crazy...     or anything...

G                 D
I can't stand to fly;
Em             C
I'm not that naive.
G                    D
Men weren't meant to ride
     Em                   C
With clouds between their knees.
           G                  D
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet,
            Em                 C
Digging for kryptonite on this one-way street;
       G                  D
Only a man in a funny red sheet,
            Em               C
Looking for special things inside of me,
          G D            Em C           G D            Em C
Inside of me...inside of me...inside of me...inside of me.
         G       D  C
It's not easy to be me.
