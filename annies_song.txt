You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest,

Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain.

Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean,

You fill up my senses,  come fill me again.

Let me drown in your laughter,  Let me die in your arms.
       A          G    A  Bm       G         D       F#m/C#  Bm
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you,

Come let me love you,  come love me again.
