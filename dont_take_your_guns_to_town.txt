  A                                 E               A
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm,
                                  E               A                     
A boy filled with wanderlust, who really meant no harm.
   D 
He changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down.
        A
And his mother cried as he walked out,
       D                 A          D                  A           
"Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. 
       D                 A
 Don't take your guns to town."

   A                                          E             A
He laughed and kissed his mom and said, "your Billy Joe's a man.
                                     E       A     
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
      D
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause, I'd gun nobody down."
        A
But she cried again as he rode away,
       D                 A          D                  A           
"Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. 
       D                 A
 Don't take your guns to town."

   A                       E                A
He sang as on he rode, his guns hung at his hips.
                              E              A 
He rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips.
   D
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down.
        A
But his mother's words echoed again:
       D                 A          D                  A           
"Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. 
       D                 A
 Don't take your guns to town."

   A                                     E                A   
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand,
                                     E            A
And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man.
  D 
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down.
       A
And he heard again his mother's words:
       D                 A          D                  A           
"Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. 
        D                A
 Don't take your guns to town."

A                                    E              A
Bill was raged and Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
                                          E            A   
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw.
   D
As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered 'round
    A
And wondered at his final words:
       D                 A          D                  A           
"Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. 
       D                 A
 Don't take your guns to town."
