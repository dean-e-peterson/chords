Intro: D/A  D/F#  Dm6/F  A/E  E7  A  E

E            A A7                  D
God sent His Son, they called Him, Jesus;
           A  E7/B  A        (Adim) Bm (Bm7) E
He came to love,     heal and for - give;
             A  A7          D
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
      Dm6 A                 E               A
An empty  grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

CHORUS:
E A     E7/B A  A7               D
Because He   lives, I can face tomorrow,
           A/E  E/D  A            Bm (Bm7) E
Because He lives,     all fear is gone;
  E7      A  Asus4  A7             D
Because I know        He holds the future,
         Dm6 A/E               E               A
And life is  worth the living, just because He lives!

E            A A7           D
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
             A  E7/B  A          (Adim) Bm (Bm7) E
And feel the pride     and joy he gives;
            A  A7            D
But greater still the calm assurance:
     Dm6   A                  E               A
This child can face uncertain days because He lives!

(Chorus)

E            A A7                D
And then one day, I'll cross the river,
                  A  E7/B  A             (Adim) Bm (Bm7) E
I'll fight life's fi    -    nal war with pain;
             A  A7              D
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
     Dm6 A                   E                A
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!

(Chorus)
