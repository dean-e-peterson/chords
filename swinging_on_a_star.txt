A13    (x00002) or (222223)     Bm7   (x20202)               E9  (020102)

(B7-5)    Bm7     E7         A13 (A11+5) A7      Am7       D7        G (Eb7 G)
Would you like to swing on a star,         Carry moonbeams home in a jar,
(B7-5) Bm7    E7           A13 (A11+5) A7  Am7             D7          G C G Am7
And be better off than you are,               Or would you rather be a mule?

          G          Am7         Bm7        Am7
        A mule is an animal with long funny ears,
           G           Am7         G (F and/or F#7) G
        He kicks up at anything he hears,
            A7      Em7    A7      D
        His back is brawny and his brain is weak,
             Em7        A7            D  Dmaj7 D7
        He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak,
                   G           C             G Dm7 E7
        And by the way, if you hate to go to school,
        Am           D7         G C G
        You may grow up to be a mule.

   (B7-5)    Bm7     E7         A13 (A11+5) A7      Am7       D7        G (Eb7 G)
Or would you like to swing on a star,         Carry moonbeams home in a jar,
(B7-5) Bm7    E7           A13 (A11+5) A7  Am(7)            D7          G C G Am7
And be better off than you are,                Or would you rather be a pig?

          G         Am7         Bm7         Am7
        A pig is an animal with dirt on his face,
            G           Am7         G F G
        His shoes are a terrible disgrace,
             A7     Em7     A7      D
        He's got no manners when he eats his food,
             Em7     A7         D  Dmaj7 D7
        He's fat and lazy and extremely rude,
                   G            C            G Dm7 E7
        But if you don't care a feather or a fig,
        Am           D7         G C G
        You may grow up to be a pig.

   (B7-5)    Bm7     E7         A13 (A11+5) A7      Am7       D7        G (Eb7 G)
Or would you like to swing on a star,         Carry moonbeams home in a jar,
(B7-5) Bm7    E7           A13 (A11+5) A7  Am(7)            D7          G C G Am7
And be better off than you are,                Or would you rather be a fish?

          G             Am7           Bm7       Am7
        A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook,
           G               Am7            G F G
        He can't write his name or read a book,
           A7       Em7    A7     D
        To fool the people is his only thought,
            Em7         A7           D     Dmaj7 D7
        And though he's slippery, he still gets caught,
                    G            C                G Dm7 E7
        But then if that sort of life is what you wish,
        Am           D7         G C G
        You may grow up to be a fish.

    (B7-5)  Bm7     E7            A13 (A11+5) A7      Am7     D7           G (Eb7 G)
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo,          Every day you meet quite a few,
(B7-5) Bm7      E7        A13 (A11+5) A7  Am7           D7              B(m)7-5  E7
So you see it's all up to you.               You can be better than you are,
Am7          D7            G C G
You could be swingin' on a star.
