I'm really still in prison, and my love she holds the key.

 [C]I'm coming home, I've [Am]done my [Em]time
Now I've [Gm7]got to know what [A]is and [Gdim]isn't [Dm]mine [A7] [Dm]
If [F]you received my [Fm]letter telling [C]you I'd soon be [Am]free
[D7]Then you know just [D9]what to do [Fm]if you [Dm7]still want [G7]me
[Fm7]If you [Gm7]still [Fm7]want [G7]me

Refrain:

Oh, [C]tie a yellow [Am7]ribbon round the [Em]old oak tree
It's been [A7]three [Gdim]long [Gm7]years, [A7]do you [Dm]still [A7]want [Dm]me?
If [F]I don't see a [Fm]ribbon round the [C]old oak [Am]tree
I'll [C]stay on the bus, [Em]forget about us,
[Am]Put the blame on [A9]me
If [Dm]I don't see a [Dm7]yellow [Fm7]ribbon [D7]round the [G]old oak [C]tree [Am] [Dm] [G7]

Verse 2:

[C]Busdriver, please [Am]look for [Em]me,
'Cause I [Gm7]couldn't bear to [A]see what [Gdim]I might [Dm]see [A7] [Dm]
I'm [F]really in [Fm]prison, and my [C]love she holds the [Am]key
A [D7]simple yellow [D9]ribbon's what I [Fm]need to [Dm7]set me [G7]free
I [Fm7]wrote and [Gm7]told [Fm7]her, [G7]please...
