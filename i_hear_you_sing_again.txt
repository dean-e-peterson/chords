I Hear You Sing Again
- Woody Guthrie/Janis Ian

           Asus2        Bm7          Asus2/C#  E
If I could only hear my mother sing again,
           Asus2             Bm7                Asus2/C#  E
If I could close my eyes and hear your voice as then,
F#m7#11                          D6
All the friends and family would sing along with me,
    Bm7                   Esus4  E
And set your spirit free.

(CHORUS)
Asus2         Bm7            Asus2/C#  E
In my heart I hear you sing again,
Asus2         Bm7        Asus/C#  E
Every note as natural as then,
D6                           C#m7
When I sing those songs with family and friends
Bm7           Esus4  (E)     Asus2
In my heart I hear you sing again.


           Asus2               Bm7                 Asus2/C#  E
I know the troubled times that turned your hair to grey,
            Asus2             Bm7              Asus2/C#  E
And all the tears and sorrows followed to your grave,
    F#m7#11                                     D6
But deep within the heart of hunger, there were always melodies,
Bm7                    Esus4  E
Passed from you to me.

(CHORUS)
Asus2         Bm7            Asus2/C#  E
In my heart I hear you sing again,
Asus2         Bm7        Asus/C#  E
Every note as natural as then,
D6                           C#m7
When I sing those songs with family and friends
Bm7           Esus4   (E)      Asus2
In my heart I hear your voice again.

And its a long, long road I've come,
C2                 G/B        A2
  Since my mother's songs were heard,
        C2    G/B  Asus2
But the child I    can't outrun,
C2               G     Esus4  E
  Still hangs on every word.

(CHORUS)
Asus2         Bm7            Asus2/C#  E
In my heart I hear you sing again,
Asus2         Bm7        Asus/C#  E
Every note as natural as then,
D6                           C#m7
When I sing those songs with family and friends
Bm7           Esus4  (E)     Asus2
In my heart I hear you sing again.
