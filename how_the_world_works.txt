[Spoken: Bo Burnham]
Hey, kids!  Today, we're gonna learn about the world.

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
The world that's around us is pretty amazing
But how does it work?
It must be complicated
The secret is the world can only work
When everything works together

[Verse 2: Bo Burham]
A bee drinks from a flower
And leaves with its pollen
A squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen
Everything works together
The biggest elephant, the littlest fly
The gophers underground, the birds in the sky
And every single cricket, every fish in the sea
Gives what they can and gets what they need

[Chorus: Bo Burnham]
That is how the world works
That is how the world works
From A to Zebra
To the worms in the dirt
That's how it works

[Spoken]
[Bo]    Hey everyone.  Look who stopped by to say "hello."  It's Socko!
[Socko] Hey!
[Bo]    Where you been, Socko?
[Socko] I've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand
        In a frightening, liminal space between states of being
        Not quite dead, not quite alive
        It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis
[Bo]    Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works
[Socko] Boy, that sounds complicated!
[Bo]    Do you have anything you'd wanna teach us about the world?
[Socko] I wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself
[Bo]    I don't know about that, Socko.  How about you give it a try?
[Socko] All right!

[Verse 3: Socko]
The simple narrative taught in every history class
Is demonstrably false and pedagogically classist
Don't you know the world is built with blood?
And genocide and exploitation
The global network of capital essentially functions
To separate the worker from the means of production
And the FBI killed Martin Luther King
Private property's inherently theft
And neoliberal fascists are destroying the left
And every politician, every cop on the street
Protects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite

[Chorus: Socko]
That is how the world works (really?)
That is how the world works
Genocide the Natives, say you got to it first
That's how it works

[Spoken]
[Bo]    That's pretty intense
[Socko] No shit
[Bo]    What can I do to help?
[Socko] Read a book or something, I don't know
        Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you
        It's incredibly exhausting
[Bo]    I'm sorry, Socko.  I was just trying to become a better person
[Socko] Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict
        Through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization?
        This isn't about you!  So either get with it, or get out of the fucking way.
[Bo]    Watch your mouth, buddy.  Remember who's on whose hand here.
[Socko] But that's what I-
        Have you not been fucking listening?
        We are entrenched in a way (all right, all right)
        Wait, wait, no please!
        I don't wanna go back, please, ugh, ugh, ugh
        I can't go, I can't go back
        Please, please, I'm sorry
[Bo]    Are you gonna behave yourself?
[Socko] Yes
[Bo]    Yes, what?
[Socko] Yes, sir-
[Bo]    Look at me
[Socko] Yes, sir
[Bo]    That's better

[Chorus: both]
That is how the world works
That is how the world works
I hope you learned your lesson [Bo]
I did and it hurt [Socko]
That's how it works

[Spoken]
[Socko] No!
