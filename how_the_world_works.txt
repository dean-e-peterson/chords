SPOKEN: [Bo]
          Em          A                                           D  D#dim
            Hey, kids!  Today, we're gonna learn about the world.

VERSE 1: [Bo]
          Em                   A                   D                                            D#dim  Em    
            The world that's around us is pretty amazing, but how does it work?  It must be compli  -  cated.
                              A              D                               D#dim 
            The secret is the world can only work, when everything works together.  

VERSE 2: [Bo]
          Em                     A                           D                                                   D#dim Em    
            A bee drinks from a flower, and leaves with its pollen.  A squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen.
                       A
            Everything works together.
          D             D#dim         Em       A   D            D#dim            Em           A   
            The biggest elephant, the littlest fly, the gophers underground, the birds in the sky, 
            F#  Bm           F#+            D/A           Bm6/G# Em                      A                   
            And every single cricket, every fish in the sea,     gives what they can and gets what they need.

CHORUS: [Bo]
            D               Bm          G                 E     A
            That is how the world works.  That is how the world works
          D                        F#7          Bm    G         A    D
            From A to Zebra to the worms in the dirt, that's how it works

SPOKEN:   D  Dmaj7  D6  Dmaj7  (repeat these chords for most of spoken section)

      [Bo]  Hey everyone.  Look who stopped by to say "hello."  It's Socko!
   [Socko]  Hey!
      [Bo]  Where you been, Socko?
   [Socko]  I've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand
            In a frightening, liminal space between states of being.  Not quite dead, not quite alive
            It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis
      [Bo]  Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works
   [Socko]  Boy, that sounds complicated!
      [Bo]  Do you have anything you'd wanna teach us about the world?
                                                         ... D
   [Socko]  I wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself
                               Dmaj7                      G               A
      [Bo]  I don't know about that, Socko.  How about you give it a try?
   [Socko]  All right.

VERSE 3: [Socko]
          Em                      A                       D                                   D#dim      Em      
            The simple narrative taught in every history class, is demonstrably false and pedagogically classist. 
                                A                  D                                D#dim 
            Don't you know the world is built with blood?  And genocide and exploitation.  
          Em                       A                   D                                                   D#dim Em     
            The global network of capital essentially functions, to separate the worker from the means of pro - duction. 
                      A                      D
            And the FBI killed Martin Luther King!
          D         D#dim        Em       A          D          D#dim          Em           A    
            Private property's inherently theft, and neoliberal fascists are destroying the left. 
            F#  Bm        F#+           D/A        Bm6/G#               Em                          Bm6/G#     A    
            And every politician, every cop on the street, protects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite. 

CHORUS: [Socko]
            D               Bm                        G                 E     A
            That is how the world works. (Bo: really?)  That is how the world works.
            D                             F#7        Bm     G         A   D
            Genocide the Natives, say you got to it first.  That's how it works.

SPOKEN:   D  Dmaj7  D6  Dmaj7  (repeat these chords for beginning of spoken section)

      [Bo]  That's pretty intense
   [Socko]  No shit
      [Bo]  What can I do to help?
   [Socko]  Read a book or something, I don't know
            Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you.  It's incredibly exhausting
      [Bo]  I'm sorry, Socko.  I was just trying to become a better person
   [Socko]  Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict
            Through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization?
            This isn't about you!  So either get with it, or get out of the fucking way.
      [Bo]  Watch your mouth, buddy.  Remember who's on whose hand here.
                                           Dmaj7                        D6
   [Socko]  But that's what I--- Have you not been fucking listening?  We are entrenched in a way ---
      [Bo]  All right, all right
                        Dmaj7                                           D
   [Socko]  Wait, wait, no please!  I don't wanna go back, please, ugh, ugh, ugh
                          Dmaj7           N.C.
            I can't go, I can't go back.  Please, please, I'm sorry
      [Bo]  Are you gonna behave yourself?
   [Socko]  Yes
      [Bo]  Yes, what?
   [Socko]  Yes, sir---
      [Bo]  Look at me
   [Socko]  Yes, sir
      [Bo]  That's better

CHORUS:     D               Bm          G                E     A     
            That is how the world works, that is how the world works.
              D
      [Bo]  I hope you learned your lesson.
              F#7        Bm
   [Socko]  I did and it hurt.
            G
    [Both]  That's how
            N.C.
   [Socko]  It works... No!
