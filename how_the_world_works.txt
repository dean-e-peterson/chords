            Hey, kids!  Today, we're gonna learn about the world.

VERSE 1: [Bo]
          Em                   A                   D
            The world that's around us is pretty amazing
                                                  D#dim  Em
            But how does it work?  It must be compli  -  cated
                              A              D
            The secret is the world can only work
                                      D#dim
            When everything works together

VERSE 2: [Bo]
          Em                     A                           D
            A bee drinks from a flower, and leaves with its pollen
                                                        D#dim Em
            A squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen
                       A
            Everything works together
          D             D#dim         Em       A
            The biggest elephant, the littlest fly
          D             D#dim            Em           A
            The gophers underground, the birds in the sky
            F#  Bm           F#+            D/A           Bm6/G#
            And every single cricket, every fish in the sea
            Em                      A
            Gives what they can and gets what they need

CHORUS: [Bo]
            D               Bm
            That is how the world works
          G                 E     A
            That is how the world works
          D                        F#7          Bm
            From A to Zebra to the worms in the dirt
            G         A    D
            That's how it works

SPOKEN:   D  Dmaj7  D6  Dmaj7  (repeat these chords for most of spoken section)

      [Bo]  Hey everyone.  Look who stopped by to say "hello."  It's Socko!
   [Socko]  Hey!
      [Bo]  Where you been, Socko?
   [Socko]  I've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand
            In a frightening, liminal space between states of being
            Not quite dead, not quite alive
            It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis
      [Bo]  Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works
   [Socko]  Boy, that sounds complicated!
      [Bo]  Do you have anything you'd wanna teach us about the world?
                                                         ... D
   [Socko]  I wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself
                               Dmaj7                      G               A
      [Bo]  I don't know about that, Socko.  How about you give it a try?
   [Socko]  All right!

VERSE 3: [Socko]
          Em                      A                       D
            The simple narrative taught in every history class
                                          D#dim      Em
            Is demonstrably false and pedagogically classist
                                A                  D
            Don't you know the world is built with blood?
                                     D#dim
            And genocide and exploitation
          Em                       A                   D
            The global network of capital essentially functions
                                                      D#dim Em
            To separate the worker from the means of pro - duction
                      A                      D
            And the FBI killed Martin Luther King
          D         D#dim        Em       A
            Private property's inherently theft
                D          D#dim          Em           A
            And neoliberal fascists are destroying the left
            F#  Bm        F#+           D/A        Bm6/G#
            And every politician, every cop on the street
                         Em                          Bm6/G#     A
            Protects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite

CHORUS: [Socko]
            D               Bm
            That is how the world works (Bo: really?)
          G                 E     A
            That is how the world works
            D                             F#7        Bm
            Genocide the Natives, say you got to it first
            G         A   D
            That's how it works

SPOKEN:   D  Dmaj7  D6  Dmaj7  (repeat these chords for part of spoken section)

   [Bo]     That's pretty intense
   [Socko]  No shit
   [Bo]     What can I do to help?
   [Socko]  Read a book or something, I don't know
            Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you
            It's incredibly exhausting
   [Bo]     I'm sorry, Socko.  I was just trying to become a better person
   [Socko]  Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict
            Through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization?
            This isn't about you!  So either get with it, or get out of the fucking way.
                                                                 ... D
   [Bo]     Watch your mouth, buddy.  Remember who's on whose hand here.
                                           Dmaj7
   [Socko]  But that's what I --- Have you not been fucking listening?
            D6
            We are entrenched in a way
   [Bo]     All right, all right
                        Dmaj7
   [Socko]  Wait, wait, no please!
                                                D
            I don't wanna go back, please, ugh, ugh, ugh
                          Dmaj7
            I can't go, I can't go back
            N.C.
            Please, please, I'm sorry
      [Bo]  Are you gonna behave yourself?
   [Socko]  Yes
      [Bo]  Yes, what?
   [Socko]  Yes, sir ---
      [Bo]  Look at me
   [Socko]  Yes, sir
      [Bo]  That's better

CHORUS:
            D               Bm
      [Bo]  That is how the world works
          G                 E     A
    [Both]  That is how the world works
              D
      [Bo]  I hope you learned your lesson
              F#7        Bm
   [Socko]  I did and it hurt
            G
    [Both]  That's how
            N.C.
   [Socko]  It works...

SPOKEN:
   [Socko]  No!
