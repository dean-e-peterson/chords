 - by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman
 - tenor range B2-E4 in A

F#dim   (xx1212) or (234242)
Bm7     (x20202) or (x24232)

       A                    E
It's a world of laughter, a world of tears;
       E7                  (F#dim) A
It's a world of hopes and a world of fears,
                        A7               D           Bm(7)
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
       E           E7    A
It's a small world after all.

CHORUS
A                  E          E7                 A
It's a small world after all, It's a small world after all,
       A7          D     Bm(7)       E      E7    A
It's a small world after all, It's a small, small world.

         A                     E
There is just one moon and one golden sun
      E7                       (F#dim) A
And a smile means friendship to everyone.
                        A7          D          Bm(7)
Though the mountains divide and the oceans are wide,
       E           E7    A
It's a small world after all.

(CHORUS - 2x)
