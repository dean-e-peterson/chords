     G                      C         (Am7)
They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia,
       G                       D7
sayin' Steve you're way behind time.
        G   (C)    (G)           C    (Am7)
This is not thirty eight this is old 97,
         G             D          G
You must pull her into Spencer on time.

        G                             C            (Am7)
(So) He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman,
     G                       D7
just shovel on a little more coal,
    G    (C)(G)        C         (Am7)
and when we cross that White Oak mountain
        G         D            G
you can watch old ninety seven roll.

       G                      C          (Am7)
It's a mighty rough road from Lenburg to Danvill,
     G                      D7
on a line with a three mile grade.
       G  (C)  (G)        C           (Am7)
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes
        G          D       G
oh, you see what a jump he made.

       G                            C               (Am7)
He was comin' down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour,
         G                    D7
when his whistle broke into a scream.
       G     (C)    (G)            C           (Am7)
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
G          D            G
scalded to death by the steam.

G       C           (Am7)
Now you ladies take warnin'
     G                D7
from this time on evermore;
      G     (C)   (G)           C             (Am7)
never speak harsh words to your true love and husband,
       G             D       G
he may leave you and never return.
