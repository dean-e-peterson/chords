A7sus4  (x02030)
Cm      (x35543)

C      D      G                         Am
Starry starry night, paint your palette blue and grey,
              C                  D                                 G
Look out on a summer's day, with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
C       D      G                               Am
Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the daffodills,
                          C                 D                         G
Catch the breeeze and the winter chills, in colors on the snowy linen land.


Chorus:
           Am  D                   G      D  Em
Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
                          Am(7)  D7                         Em
How you suffered for your sanity, how you tried to set them free.
                               A7sus4   A7 Am7  D7                     G
They would not listen they did not know how.    Perhaps they'll listen now.


C      D      G                           Am
Starry starry night, flaming flowers that brightly blaze,
                   C              D                                G
Swirling clouds in violet haze, reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue.
C      D        G                      Am
Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain,
                C                  D                                   G
Weathered faces lined in pain, are soothed 'neath the artists's loving hand.

(Chorus?)

                   Am      D(7)                      G  D  Em
For they could not love you, but still your love was true,
            Am                              Cm
And when no hope was left in sight, on that starry starry night,
    G                 F7           E7
You took your life as lovers often do,
      Am
But I could have told you, Vincent,
     C                                D7           G
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.


C      D       G                        Am
Stary, starry  night, portraits hung in empty halls,
                   C                    D                                   G
Frameless heads on nameless walls, with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
         C        D           G                      Am
Like the stranger that you've met, the ragged man in ragged clothes.
                    C                D                                G
The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.


              Am   D                 G   D  Em
Now I think I know what you tried to say to me,
                          Am(7)  D                          Em
How you suffered for your sanity, how you tried to set them free.
                                  A7sus4    A7  Am7
They would not listen they're not listening still,
   D               G
Perhaps they never will.
