Go away from my window, 
G (or C)      D          G
Leave at your own chosen speed.
G                   Am 
I'm not the one you want, babe,

I'm not the one you need.

To protect you and defend you

Whether you are right or wrong, 
    C                          D 
Someone to open each and every door,

             G          C       D            G
But it ain't me, babe.  No, no, no, it ain't me, babe.

It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go lightly from the ledge babe,

Go lightly on the ground.

I'm not the one you want babe,

I'll only let you down.

Who'll promise never to part.

Someone to close his eyes for you,
    Bm               Am 
Someone to close his heart,
    C                            D
Someone who will die for you and more,

             G          C       D            G
But it ain't me, babe.  No, no, no, it ain't me, babe.

You say you're lookin for someone
            Bm               Am
To pick you up each time you fall,
   Bm             Am
To gather flowers constantly 
       Bm                 Am
And to come each time you call,
  C                               D
A lover for your life and nothing more,

             G          C       D            G
But it ain't me, babe.  No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. 
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
