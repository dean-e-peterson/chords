D7     G                    C
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,
    G                C
I'm standing here outside the door
  G                C             D7
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye.
        G                      C
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn',
G                        C
The Taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn.
  G            Am (or C)        D7
Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

           G           C
        So kiss me and smile for me,
        G                   C
        Tell me that you'll wait for me,
        G                Am           D(sus4)  D7
        Hold me like you never let me go.
                   G       C
        'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,
        G               C                 G
        Don't know when I'll be back again.
           Am              D7
        Oh babe, I hate to go.


D7         G               C
There's so many times I've let you down,
   G               C
So many times I've played around,
  G            C                 D7
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
      G               C
Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,
      G             C
Ev'ry song I sing I sing for you.
     G                Am (or C)          D7
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.

        So kiss me ...


G                C
Now the time has come to leave you,
G             C
One more time let me kiss you,
     G                C             D7
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
G               C
Dream about the days to come,
     G               C
When I won't have to leave alone,
 G              Am (or C)       D7
About the times I won't have to say.

        Kiss me ...
