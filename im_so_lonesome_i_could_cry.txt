G         D6/F#    Em      D6/F#     G          D6/F#   Dm7  (Dm7sus4  Dm7)
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill.  He sounds too blue to fly.
    C        Am7      G                             D       G  D6/F#  Em  D6/F#
The midnight train is whining low.  I'm so lonesome I could cry.


     G     D6/F#  Em       D6/F#      G         D6/F#    Dm7  (Dm7sus4  Dm7)
I've never seen a night so long, when time goes crawling by.
    C         Am7    G                         D        G  D6/F#  Em  D6/F#
The moon just went behind a cloud, to hide its face and cry.


        G    D6/F# Em    D6/F#      G        D6/F#  Dm7  (Dm7sus4  Dm7)
Did you ever see a robin weep, when leaves began to die?
     C          Am7      G                              D       G D6/F# Em D6/F#
That means he's lost the will to live.  I'm so lonesome I could cry.


    G       D6/F# Em      D6/F#        G    D6/F#  Dm7  (Dm7sus4  Dm7)
The silence of a  falling star, lights up a purple sky.
    C    Am7    G         (Em)        (G)      D       G  D6/F#  Em  D6/F#
And as I wonder where you are, I'm so lonesome I could cry.
