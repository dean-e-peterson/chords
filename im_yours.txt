I'm Yours
 - by Jason Mraz
 - chords by Anton Petersson, possibly tweaked a bit
 - originally in B (I transposed it to A)

A   (577655)
E   (x79997)
F#m (x9bba9) in hex, or (x-9-11-11-10-9)
D   (x57775)

Intro:  A  E  F#m  D  (x2)

     A
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it,
  E
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
  F#m
I fell right through the cracks
            D
and now I'm trying to get back.
           A
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest,
E
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention,
  F#m                          D
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some.

A           E                F#m
I won't hesitate no more, no more
          D
It cannot wait, I'm yours.



Well open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
A lá peaceful melodies

*until:*                                                 (no, Bm or B?)
F#m                                     D                     Ebm
     It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love loved

*same chords*
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

*Now he starts humming *

A / E - F#m / C#m - D - Ebm x2

*From here on it's A-E-F#m-D until the end of the song*
