CHORUS:
(C)                Dm7  G7
Make the world go away,
                  C
And get it off my shoulders.
                           F   G7
Say the things you used to say,
                       C   F C
And make the world go away.


C                        G(7)
Do you remember when you loved me,
           (G7)           C
Before the world took me astray.
                  F
If you do then forgive me,
G7                     C    F C
And make the world go away.


(Chorus)


I'm sorry if I hurt you,
I'll make it up - day by day.
Just say you love me like you used to,
And make the world go away.


(Chorus)


C                          F   G7
Say the things you used to say,
                       C   F C
And make the world go away.
