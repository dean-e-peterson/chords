Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,

Naught be all else to me, save that thou art;
G               D       F#m Bm F#m G Gmaj7 A
Thou my best thought by day or by  night,
Bm     F#m G    D        Em       A7 D
Waking or  sleeping, thy presence my light.

D          G       A   D       A    D
Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word,
A     (Em)       D   G        (Bm) Asus4 Asus2 A
I ever with thee and thou with me  Lord;
G               D         F#m Bm  F#m  G Gmaj7 A
Thou my great Father, and I   thy true son;
Bm      F#m G   D         Em     A7   D
Thou in me  dwelling, and I with thee one.

D          G      A       D         A   D
Be thou my battle shield, sword for the fight;
A         (Em)  D   G      (Bm)  Asus4 Asus2 A
Be thou my dignity, thou my de - light;
G                  D    F#m  Bm F#m  G Gmaj7 A
Thou my soul's shelter, thou my high tower:
Bm         F#m G     D       Em       A7 D
Raise thou me  heavenward, O Power of my power.

D        G         A   D        A  D
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise:
A          (Em) D     G      (Bm)  Asus4 Asus2 A
Thou mine inheritance now and al - ways;
G              D   F#m   Bm F#m G Gmaj7 A
Thou and thou only first in my  heart;
Bm        F#m G  D       Em       A7   D
High King of  Heaven, my treasure thou art.

D            G       A  D    A  D
High King of heaven, my victory won,
A           (Em)     D     G        (Bm)     Asus4 Asus2 A
May I reach heaven's joys, O Bright Heav'n's sun!
G               D             F#m Bm   F#m  G Gmaj7 A
Heart of my own heart, what - e - ver  be - fall,
Bm       F#m G D       Em    A7 D
Still be my  vision, O Ruler of all.
