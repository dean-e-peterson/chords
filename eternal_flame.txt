Intro:  G  Gsus  G  Gsus  G

G          Em    C            D
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling.
G      Em            C        D           Em
Do you feel my heart beating, do you understand?
       B7       Em
Do you feel the same?
A7        D    Bm
Am I only dreaming,
Am                  D7     G
Is this burning an eternal flame?


G   Em    C             D
I believe it's meant to be, darling
G           Em           C         D               Em
I watch you when you are sleeping; you belong with me
       B7       Em
Do you feel the same?
A7        D    Bm
Am I only dreaming,
   Am                  C      D
Or is this burning an eternal flame?


D      (Dm)  G                      D
Say my name, sun shines through the rain
        F       G
A whole life so lonely
             C        Em       Am
And then you come and ease the pain
D                         F   C    D
I don't want to lose this feeling.


Instrumental:  Em  B7  Em  A7  D  Bm  C  D


D      (Dm)  G                      D
Say my name, sun shines through the rain
        F       G
A whole life so lonely
             C        Em       Am
And then you come and ease the pain
D                         F   C    D
I don't want to lose this feeling


G          Em    C            D
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling.
G      Em            C        D           Em
Do you feel my heart beating, do you understand?
       B7       Em
Do you feel the same?
A7        D    Bm
Am I only dreaming,
    Am              C   D      G
But is this burning an eternal flame?              (last chorus 3x?)
