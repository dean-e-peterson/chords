Roller Derby Queen
 - by Jim Croce, in E

E
Gonna tell you a story you won't believe
    A7
But I fell in love last Friday evening
       B7              A7          E7
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen
           E
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat
         A
When she caught my eye and I put it back
    B7               A                        E7
And ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers

CHORUS:
E              G                     A            E
The night that I fell in love with a roller derby queen
E7        E6      E7       E6
(Round and round, oh round and round)
G                          A            B7
Meanest hunk o' woman that anybody ever seen
                   E
Down in the arena, huh

Verse 2
E
She was five-foot-six and two-fifteen
  A7
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean
    B7                           A7                      E7
She knew how to knuckle, and she knew how to scuffle and fight
E
The roller derby program said that
        A
She was built like a 'frigerator with a head
    B7                       A                        E7
Her fans call her Tuffy, but all her buddies call her Spike

(CHORUS)

Instrumental Bridge:  E  A  B7  A7  E7

Verse 3.
E
Well I could not help but to fall in love
          A7
With this heavy-duty woman I've been speakin' of
B7                               A7                     E7
Things were kind of bad 'til the day she skated into my life
E
Well she might be nasty, she might be fat
      A
But I never met a person who would tell her that
         B7                       A                       E7
She's my bleech blonde bomber, my heavy-handed Hackensack mama

(CHORUS 2x)
