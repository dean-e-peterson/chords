Your cheating heart will make you weep.
               G7              C    G7 
You'll cry and cry, and try to sleep,
                C   C7               F
But sleep won't come the whole night through,
              G7                 C
Your cheating heart will tell on you.
 
     C7         F                 C
When tears come down like falling rain,
             D7                G   G7
You'll toss around and call my name.
                C    C7         F
You'll walk the floor the way I do,
              G7                 C
Your cheating heart will tell on you.
 
C    G7       C    C7             F
Your cheating heart will pine someday,
              G7              C  G7
And crave the love you threw away.
              C   C7              F
The time will come when you'll be blue,
              G7                 C
Your cheating heart will tell on you.
 
     C7         F                 C
When tears come down like falling rain,
            D7                 G   G7
You'll toss around and call my name.
                C    C7         F
You'll walk the floor the way I do,
              G7                 C
Your cheating heart will tell on you.
