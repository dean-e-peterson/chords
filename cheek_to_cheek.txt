F/C C C/G Dm7 C/G G7 F/C C C/G Dm7
Hea-ven       I'm in Hea-ven
C/G G7 C           G7/D    D#dim7 Em7    Bb9#11 A7
And my heart beats so that I can  hardly speak.
Bm/D D7 G7      Dm7      G7/D F/G  G9 E7/B Bb7b5 A7
And  I  seem to find the happiness I  seek,
           Dm7            G7      F/G   G7  C  Cmaj7/E Dm7 G7#5
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek.

C/G G7  C          G7/D  D#dim7   C/E         Bb9#11 A7
And the cares that hung around me through the week.
Bm/D D7 G7     Dm7    G7/D      F/G G9 E7/B Bb7b5 A7
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky  streak,
           Dm7            G7      F/G   G7  C Dm7/G C6
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek.

      G7/D    G7        C6    C/G      G7/D      G7        C6 C/G
Oh, I love to climb a mountain, and to reach the highest peak,
       G7/D    G7        C6       C/E    Dm7     G7       C6  C/G
But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek.
      G7/D    G7       C6   C/G   G7/D  G7     C6
Oh, I love to go out fishing in a river or a creek,
      G7/D    G7     C6        C/E   Dm7     G7       C6
But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek.

Cm         Cm7           Ab9
Dance with me, I want my arm about you.
Ab9/Gb Fdim7  G7b9     G#dim7 Am    C/G  D9/F# G7
The    charm about you will   carry me through to

F/C C C/G Dm7 C/G G7 F/C C C/G Dm7
Hea-ven       I'm in Hea-ven
C/G G7 C           G7/D    D#dim7 C/E    Bb9#11 A7
And my heart beats so that I can  hardly speak.
Bm/D D7 G7      Dm7      G7/D F/G  G9 E7/B Bb7b5 A7
And  I  seem to find the happiness I  seek,
           Dm7            G7      F/G   G7  C Ebdim7 Dm G7 (to beginning...)
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek.
                            (...final time) C Dm7/G C6
