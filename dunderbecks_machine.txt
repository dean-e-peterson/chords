Dunderbeck's Machine

      D                              G
There was a fine old German man, his name was Dunderbeck.
                    A              D
He was very fond of sauerkraut and sausages and speck.
   D                                G
He had a great big butcher shop the finest ever seen,
                 A                           D
And created an invention to make sausages by steam.

(Chorus)
D                          G
Oh, Mister Dunderbeck, how could you be so mean.
                     A            D
We're sorry you have invented the wonderful machine.
        D                                     G
Now the pussycats and the long-tailed rats no longer they'll be seen,
                           A                              D
For we'll grind them up to sausage meat in Dunderbeck's machine.

        D                               G
One day something was the matter, the machine it would not go,
                 A                 D
So Dunderbeck he climbed inside to find her out you know.
    D                                G
His wife was in a nightmare, she was walking in her sleep.
                           A                               D
She grabbed the crank, and gave a yank, and Dunderbeck was meat.


(Chorus)
