Intro:  Gm Eb (D)  repeat, then  C  D

G          Em
I, I gotta new life,
          C           D               G
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad.
            Em     C       D          G
How could a person like me care for you?
         Em          C              D        G
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
     Am   D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.  Is enough, enough?
 

CHORUS:
G         Em           C            D               G
I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign.
          Em      C            D
Life is demanding without understanding.
G         Em          C            D               G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign.
               Em                  C                    D     C(7)  Eb  D
No one's gonna drag you up, to get into the light where you belong
    (Eb)     D     Gm   Eb (D)  Gm  Eb  D  G    
But where do you belong?


G         Em
Under the pale moon,
       C            D              G
For so many years I wonder who you are.
            Em     C        D          G
How could a person like you bring me joy?
          Em              C       D       G
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars.
     Am   D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.  Is enough, enough?


(Repeat chorus)


G         Em          C            D 
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind,
         G                    Em 
And I am happy now living without you,
     C         D
I've left you, oh, oh, oh, oh.
G         Em          C            D               G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign,
               Em                  C                    D
No one's gonna drag you out to get into the light where you belong.

G         Em      C         D
I saw the sign, I saw the sign.  (I saw the sign.)
G         Em      C         D
I saw the sign, I saw the sign.  (I saw the sign.)
G         Em           C            D               G
I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign.
