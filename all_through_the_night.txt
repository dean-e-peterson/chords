All Through The Night
- traditional Welsh (Ar Hyd a Nos)
- english lyrics by Sir Harold Boulton

G         C          A       D
Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
C   D           G
All through the night.
G        C      A        D
Guardian angels God will send thee
C   D           G
All through the night.
C                             G
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping.
Am                       D
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping.
G     C      A     D
I, my loving vigil keeping
C   D           G
All through the night.

G         C        A        D
While the moon her watch is keeping
C   D           G
All through the night.
G         C     A        D
While the weary world is sleeping
C   D           G
All through the night.
C                      G
O'er thy spirit gently stealing
Am                   D
Visions of delight revealing
G          C        A    D
Breathes a pure and holy feeling
C   D           G
All through the night.
