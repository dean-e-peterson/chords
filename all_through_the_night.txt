All Through The Night
- traditional Welsh (Ar Hyd a Nos)
- english lyrics by Sir Harold Boulton

Gsus4   (320013)
Cmaj7   (x32000)
Cadd9   (x32030)

G         C          A       D
Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.

G        C      A        D
Guardian angels God will send thee

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.

C   (Cmaj7  C   Cadd9  C     Cadd9  C    Cmaj7)
C                                        G
Soft the    drowsy     hours are    creeping.

Am                       D
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping.

G     C      A     D
I, my loving vigil keeping

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.



G         C        A        D
While the moon her watch is keeping

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.

G         C     A        D
While the weary world is sleeping

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.

C   (Cmaj7  C   Cadd9  C   Cadd9  C    Cmaj7)
C                                      G
O'er thy    spirit     gently     stealing

Am                   D
Visions of delight revealing

G          C        A    D
Breathes a pure and holy feeling

C   D           G  (Gsus4 G)
All through the night.
