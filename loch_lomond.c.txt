'Twas there that we parted, in yon shady glen
       C            Am          F G
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond
      F         Am       Dm               F
Where in purple hue, the hieland hills we view

And the moon coming out in the gloam -  ing

[Verse 3]
    C           Am            F           G
The wee birdies sing, and the wildflowers spring
       C            Am         F   G
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping
        F               Am       Dm             F
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring again
G        C          Am               Dm   G  C
Tho' the waeful may cease frae their grie -  ving

[Chorus]
    C              Am             F             G
Oh! Ye'll tak' the high road, and I'll tak' the low road
    C          Am        F    G
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
    F         Am             Dm          F
But me and my true love will never meet again
G      C              Am            Dm  G  C
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lo  -  mond
