      Em                               G
While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo.
      Em                               G       (B7)
While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo.
      Em                D
While goin' the road to sweet Athy,
  C                      B
A stick in me hand and a tear in me eye,
  Em      B7     Em      Am6
A doleful damsel I heard cry,
Em      (B7sus4) Bm7  Em
Johnny I hard  - ly   knew ye.

CHORUS:
With your drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo.
With your drums and guns and guns and drums, hurroo, hurroo.
With your drums and guns and guns and drums,
The enemy nearly slew ye.
Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo.
Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo.
Where are the eyes that looked so mild,
When my heart you so beguiled.
Why did ye scadaddle from me and the child?
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.

(Chorus)

Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo.
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo.
Where are your legs that used to run,
When you went to carry a gun,
Indeed your dancing days are done,
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.

(Chorus)

I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo.
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo.
I'm happy for to see ye home,
All from the island of Sulloon,
So low in the flesh, so high in the bone,
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.

(Chorus)

Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo.
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo.
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg,
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg,
Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg.
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.

(Chorus)

They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo.
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo.
They're rolling out the guns again,
But they'll never will take my sons again,
No they'll never will take my sons again.
Johnny I'm swearing to ye.

(Chorus)
