C         A     Dm        G      C       A             Dm      G
Spring is here, spring is here.  Life is skittles, and life is beer.
Dm                    C           F       G   C
I think the loveliest time of the year is the spring,
  A          Dm                 G
I do.  Don't you?  ['Course you do.]
            G                              C
But there's one thing that makes spring complete for me,
    D                    G           Gmaj7 G7
and makes every Sunday a treat for me.

        C              Cmaj7     C6          C
All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon
                     A              Dm (G Dm G)
when we're poisoning pigeons in the park.
     Dm            Dm-maj7 Dm7            Dm6
Each Sunday you'll see, my sweetheart and me
      Dm or F    G              C (C6 C7)
as we poison the pigeons in the park.
     Fm                      C
When they see us coming, the birdies all try an' hide.
         D                         G           G7
But they still go for peanuts when coated with cyanide.
    C             Cmaj7        C6              C
The sun's shining bright, everything seems all right,
           Dm7       G              C A Dm G C A Dm G
when we're poisoning pigeons in the park.

      Fadd9       F         Csus4         C
We've gained notoriety, and caused much anxiety
       Fadd9     F              Csus4 C
in the Audubon Society with our games.
     Asus4     A          Dm7        Dm6
They call it impiety, and lack of propriety,
     Asus4     A        Dm7        G
 and quite a variety of unpleasant names.
         D                 G         D                    G7
But it's not against any religion to want to dispose of a pigeon.

      C             Cmaj7           C6            C
So if Sunday you're free, why don't you come with me,
                     A              Dm (G Dm G)
and we'll poison the pigeons in the park.
    Dm          Dm-maj7 Dm7         Dm6
and maybe we'll do in a squirrel or two,
            Dm or F   G              C (C6 C7)
while we're poisoning pigeons in the park.

      Fm                   C
We'll murder them all amid laughter and merriment.
  D                        G         G7
except for the few we take home to experiment.
   C             Cmaj7           C6           C
My pulse will be quickenin' with each drop of strychnine
Dm7          G           Dm7          G            Dm7      G             C G C
we feed to a pigeon.  It just takes a smidgen!  to poison a pigeon in the park.
