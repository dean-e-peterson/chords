Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you.

Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new.

Flashback,    warm nights, almost left   behind.

Suitcase of  memories.  Time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead.

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said.

Then you say,     go  slow, I fall   behind.

If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting, time after time.

Af-ter my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray.

Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK.

Secrets     stolen from deep   inside.
