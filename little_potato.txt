          C            F           C
You're my little potato, you're my little potato, 
                              F       G7
You're my little potato, they dug you up,
                   C       C7  C  C7
You come from underground!

             Dm      G              C or Am
The world is big, so big, it's very big!
   Dm        G                Am or C?  Gsus4  G 
To you, it's new, it's new to you!

You're my little potato, you're my little potato, 
You're my little potato, they dug you up, 
You come from underground!

Let's talk about root crops (they dug you up), 
And lamb chops (they chew on you), 
And things to eat...like apples 
and cheese and 'nanas and cream, 
Jellies and butter, 
it's late at night, I hope this little bottle helps you go to sleep!

They must have grown you wild, 
you make a grown man a child, 
Iâ€™ll go and play in the mud 
to be with you my spud (potato). 
When you came out looking red as a beet, 
You had wrinkles on the bottoms of your feet!

Oh, you are so sweet potato! 
You're my sweet potato, 
you're my sweet potato, dug you up! 
You come from underground!

You smile, a smile, a little smile! 
The world is small, so small, it's very small!

You're my little potato, you're my little potato, 
you're my little potato, they dug you up, 
You come from underground!

You're my little potato, you're my little potato, 
you're my little potato!
