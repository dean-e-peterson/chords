(Ghost) Riders in the Sky (A Cowboy Legend)
 - by Stan Jones

F6      (xx0211)

   Am                             C
An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day,
 Am                                         C
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
     Am                           Dm               Am
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
F                   F6              Am
Plowin' through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw,

      Am                                  C
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
      Am                                                       C
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
  Am                                    Dm                    Am
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
       F              F6                  Am
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry.

CHORUS:
         C             Am
Yippe-ai-oh, yippee-ai-ay,  (Coyote Yip)
F            Dm(7)  Am
Ghost riders in the sky,

(One verse Instrumental Guitar & Banjo)

      Am                                          C
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat,
     Am                                                      C
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught them yet,
              Am                          Dm              Am
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
    F               F6            Am
All horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry.

       Am                         C
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name,
       Am                                                C
If you want to save your soul from hell, a ridin' on our range,
     Am                               Dm               Am
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride,
F                   F6             Am
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies.

CHORUS:
         C             Am
Yippe-ai-oh, yippee-ai-ay,  (Coyote Yip)
F            Dm(7)  Am
Ghost riders in the sky,
F            Dm(7)  Am
Ghost riders in the sky,
F            Dm(7)  Am  (11 bars, then fade)
Ghost riders in the sky.
