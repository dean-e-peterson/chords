It Is Well With My Soul (in C)
 - Lyrics by H. G. Spafford, music by Phillip P. Bliss, tenor range D3-D4 in C

Intro: C  (C7)  F  Em   Dm  G  C  (or C F C G C)

     C              G   C Dm G       C
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
Em   Am           D           G
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
G7  C       F         (A7) D            G
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
G7    C     C/E  F  C/G   G       C
It is well, it   is well, with my soul.

       C               G    C      Dm G          C
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Em   Am           D          G
Let  this blest assurance control,
G7   C            F     (A7) D          G
That Christ has regarded my  helpless estate,
G7       C    C/E  F   C/G   G      C
And hath shed His  own blood for my soul.

Refrain:
      G        (Gsus4 G)              C          (Csus4 C)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (C7) F     Em    Dm    G       C  (alternate chords)
       F           C     G       C
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.


   C                  G  C    Dm  G    C
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
Em  Am          D            G
My  sin, not in part but the whole,
G7 C             F      (A7)  D          G
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
G7         C     C/E    F   C/G   G    C
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

    C                 G  C  Dm     G        C
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
Em  Am      D             G
If  Jordan above me shall roll,
G7 C             F     (A7)   D           G
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
G7        C   C/E  F   C/G   G     C
Thou wilt whisper  Thy peace to my soul.

Refrain:
      G        (Gsus4 G)              C          (Csus4 C)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (C7) F     Em    Dm    G       C  (alternate chords)
       F           C     G       C
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.


     C                    G   C   Dm G      C
But, Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
Em   Am           D             G
The  sky, not the grave, is our goal;
G7  C            F     (A7) D            G
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
G7      C     C/E  F  C/G  G     C
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

    C                   G    C  Dm    G        C
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
Em   Am               D         G
The  clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
G7  C             F      (A7)    D            G
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
G7   C   C/E  F  C/G  G       C
Even so, it   is well with my soul.

Refrain:
      G        (Gsus4 G)              C          (Csus4 C)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (C7) F     Em    Dm    G       C  (alternate chords)
       F           C     G       C
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.
