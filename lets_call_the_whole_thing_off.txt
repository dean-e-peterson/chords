VERSE:

D           B7        Em       A7        D        Dmaj7   G9
Things have come to a pretty pass, our romance is growing flat,
    D+       F#9          B7          D        E7       A7  A+
For you like this and the other while I go for this and that.
D        B7             Em         A7      D          (Dmaj7)   G9
Goodness knows what the end will be; Oh, I don't know where I'm at.
   A           F#m6 E7                A6       Gm6   A7      D  D7  Bm  D7
It looks as if we   two will never be one, Something must be done.


CHORUS 1:                                      CHORUS 2:

G       Em          C6    D7                   You say laughter and I say lawfter,
You say ee-ther and I say eye-ther,            You say after and I say awfter;
G       Em           C6    D7                  Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter,
You say nee-ther and I say ny-ther;            Let's call the whole thing off,
G        G7        C         Cm
Ee-ther, eye-ther, nee-ther, ny-ther,          You like vanilla and I like vanella,
G              Em          A7  D7              You sasparilla, and I sasparella;
Let's call the whole thing off.                Vanilla, vanella ... chocolate, strawberry!
                                               Let's call the whole thing off.

G          Em       C6       D7                But oh!  If we call the whole thing off,
You like potato and I like potahto,            then we must part.
G          Em       C6       D7                And oh!  If we ever part, then that
You like tomato and I like tomahto;            might break my heart.
G         G7       C       (G) Cm6
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto,              So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters,
G     C        D7    C     G                   I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters.
Let's call the whole thing off.                For we know we need each other so we
                                               better call the calling off off.
                                               Let's call the whole thing off!
    Em6  F#7            Bm    D6    E7
But oh!  If we call the whole thing off,
      C6     D7
then we must part.
    Em6  F#7        Bm    D6   E7
And oh!  If we ever part, then that            CHORUS 3:  (Not in some renditions)
         C6    D    D7
might break my heart.                          I say father, and you say pater,
                                               I saw mother, and you say mater;
                                               Pater, mater ... uncle, auntie!
      G          G6         C6       D7        Let's call the whole thing off.
So if you like pajam-as and I like pajah-mas,
G           G6         C6        D7            I like bananas and you like banahnahs,
I'll wear pajam-as and give up pajah-mas.      I say Havana and I get Havahnah,
G      G7      C               (G) Cm6         Bananas, banahnahs, Havana, Havahnah,
For we know we need each other so we           Go your way, I'll go mine.
G               F7          E7
better call the calling off off.               So if I go for scallops and you go for lobsters,
C6    Bm       Cmaj7 D7    G  Eb7 D+           So ...all right, no contest we'll order lobster.
Let's call the whole thing off!                For we know we need each other so we
                                               better call the calling off off,
                                               C6    Bm       Cmaj7 D7    G A#dim G6
                                               Let's call the whole thing off.
