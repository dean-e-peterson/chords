Jesus Loves Me
 - words by Anna Bartlett Warner, Susan Warner, William Batchelder Bradbury,
   and possibly David Rutherford McGuire (just look it up on Wikipedia)
 - standard tune by William Batchelder Bradbury?

C           (G  C)           F             C            
Jesus loves me! This I know, for the Bible tells me so. 
C          (G  C)          F        C         G(7)  C       
Little ones to Him belong; they are weak, but He is strong. 

Chorus:
C          F
Yes, Jesus loves me!
C          G       (G7)
Yes, Jesus loves me!
C          F
Yes, Jesus loves me!
    C     G(7)     C
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! This I know, as He loved so long ago,
Taking children on His knee, saying “Let them come to Me.”

Chorus

Jesus loves me when I'm good, when I do the things I should,
Jesus loves me when I'm bad, though it makes Him very sad.

Chorus

Jesus loves me still today, walking with me on my way,
Wanting as a friend to give, light and love to all who live.

Chorus

Jesus loves me! He who died, heaven’s gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin, let His little child come in.

Chorus

Jesus loves me! Loves me still, tho' I'm very weak and ill;
That I might from sin be free, bled and died upon the tree.

Chorus

Jesus loves me! He will stay, close beside me all the way;
Thou hast bled and died for me, I will henceforth live for Thee.

Chorus
