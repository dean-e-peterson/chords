C                             G7
Have I told you lately that I love you
                                C
Could I tell you once again somehow
C7     F                          C        F   C
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you
     G7                      C
Well darling I'm telling you now

(Chorus)
     C7          F                          C
This heart would break in two if you refuse me
       G7                  C
I'm no good without you anyhow
C7          F                           C
Dear have I told you lately that I love you
     G7                      C
Well darling I'm telling you now

                             G7
Have I told you lately how I miss you
                                  C
When the stars are shining in the sky
C7     F                           C         F          C
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me
     G7                      C
Well darling I'm telling you now

(Chorus)
                                G7
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
                               C
Every dream I dream is you somehow
C7     F                        C        F      C
Have I told you who I'd like to share my love forever
     G7                      C
Well darling I'm telling you now

(Chorus)
