Smile, though your heart is aching,
Fmaj7       F6
Smile, even though it's breaking,
Dm             Fdim          Gm  (Adim   Gm) D7-9
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by,
Gm D7  Gm
If you smile through your fear and sorrow,
Bbm           Eb6/9
Smile, and maybe tomorrow,
F                               Gm          C7
You'll see the sun come shining through for you.


F             Fmaj9         F6
Light up your face with gladness,
Fmaj7      F6
Hide every trace of sadness.
Dm         Fdim        Gm (Adim Gm) D7-9
Although a tear may be ev -  er so  near,
Gm     D7  Gm
That's the time you must keep on trying,
Bbm               Eb6/9
Smile, what's the use of crying?
F                                   Gm
You'll find that life is still worthwhile,
   C7          F  Fmaj7  F6  Fmaj7
If you'll just smile.
