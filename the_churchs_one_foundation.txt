The Church's one foundation, is Jesus Christ her Lord;
A7  D      D+      F#  G     D  Gmaj7 E7      A    
She is His new cre-a - tion, by water and the word: 
     D     (Dsus4 D Dsus4)  G      D       Bm F#7 Bm B  Em    
From heav'n He came and     sought her, to be His ho-ly bride; 
A    D      (Dsus4 D) Gsus2  G        Em7     Asus4 A7 D    
With His own blood He bought her, and for her life  He died. 

 D       (Dsus4 D) A7    D   Em       A  (A7) D
Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth; 
A7  D       D+     F# G     D   Gmaj7     E7         A    
Her charter of sal-va-tion: one Lord, one faith, one birth; 
    D (Dsus4 D Dsus4)  G    D      Bm    F#7 Bm B Em    
One holy Name she      blesses, partakes one holy food, 
A   D     (Dsus4 D) Gsus2 G       Em7   Asus4 A7 D    
And to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.
 
       D     (Dsus4 D)    A7  D   Em      A  (A7) D
Though with a scornful wonder men see her sore op-pressed, 
A7 D       D+    F# G    D  Gmaj7 E7      A    
By schisms rent asunder, by her-e-sies distressed: 
    D     (Dsus4 D Dsus4)  G   D          Bm  F#7  Bm   B   Em    
Yet saints their watch are keeping, their cry goes up, "How long?" 
A   D       (Dsus4 D) Gsus2  G         Em7    Asus4 A7 D    
And soon the night of weep - ing shall be the morn  of song!

    D          (Dsus4 D) A7    D   Em        A (A7) D
The church shall never perish, her dear Lord to de-fend,
A7 D        D+        F# G     D  Gmaj7    E7     A    
To guide, sustain and cherish, is with her to the end.
       D   (Dsus4 D Dsus4) G    D        Bm    F#7  Bm B   Em    
Though there be those that hate her, and false sons in her pale,
A   D       (Dsus4 D) Gsus2  G        Em7  Asus4 A7 D    
A - gainst a foe  or  trai - tor, She ever shall prevail.

     D       (Dsus4 D)  A7    D   Em     A (A7) D
'Mid toil and trib-u-la-tion, and tumult of her war, 
A7  D         D+      F# G    D  Gmaj7    E7  A    
She waits the con-sum-ma-tion of peace forevermore; 
      D   (Dsus4 D Dsus4) G   D     Bm      F#7 Bm   B   Em    
'Til, with the  vi-sion   glorious, her longing eyes are blessed, 
A   D        (Dsus4  D)  Gsus2 G          Em7    Asus4  A7 D    
And the great Church vic-tor - ious shall be the Church at rest.

    D      (Dsus4 D)    A7   D    Em      A   (A7) D
Yet she on earth hath union, with God the Three in One,
A7  D      D+       F# G    D    Gmaj7       E7      A    
And mystic sweet communion, with those whose rest is won.
  D (Dsus4 D Dsus4) G D          Bm   F#7 Bm    B    Em    
O happy ones and    holy!  Lord, give us  grace that we,
A    D        (Dsus4 D) Gsus2 G      Em7      Asus4 A7   D      G D
Like them, the meek and low - ly, on high may dwell with Thee.  A-men.
