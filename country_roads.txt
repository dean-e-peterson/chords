Country Roads
 - by John Denver, original key A?, this in C

C              Am
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
G                     F          C
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                   Am
Life is old there, older than the trees,
G                           F              C
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.


C                      G            Am        F
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong:
     C                  G              F             C
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.


C                Am
All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
G             F                C
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                Am
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
G                         F              C
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.


C                      G            Am        F
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong:
     C                  G              F             C
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.


(BRIDGE)
Am         G             C
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me,
    F       C              G
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Am               Bb
And drivin' down the road,
        F              C                     G                G7
I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.


C                      G            Am        F
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong:
     C                  G              F             C
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.
