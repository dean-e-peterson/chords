A      (x02220)                     D#dim  (xx1212) or (234242)
Amaj7  (x02120)                     E7     (020130) or (020100)
A6     (x02222)                     E+5    (xx2110)
A#dim  (xx2323) or (x12020)         F#     (244322)
Bm7    (x20202)                     F#7    (242322)


E    E7 A                  Amaj7         A6             A
Just re-member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
    A                 A6     (A#dim7)  E7
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour,
       E7          Bm7              E7              Bm7
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
  E7              Bm7      (E+5)    A    (E7)
A sun that is the source of all our power.
    A               Amaj7          A6                A
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
    F#(7)                       Bm
Are moving at a million miles a day
      Bm           D#dim7        A                 F#(7)
In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
       Bm        E7              A
Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'.


E7  A        Amaj7           A6              A
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
       A                A6         (A#dim7) E7
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side.
   E7            Bm7             E7                   Bm7
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
           E7                  Bm7      (E+5)       A    (E7)
But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide.
      A               Amaj7            A6               A
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point.
       F#(7)                           Bm
We go 'round every two hundred million years,
        Bm        D#dim7      A           F#(7)
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
        Bm            E7         A
In this amazing and expanding universe.


E7  A          Amaj7           A6            A
The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
   A            A6     (A#dim7) E7
In all of the directions it can whizz
   E7             Bm7        E7                  Bm7
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
       E7              Bm7         (E+5)      A                      (E7)
Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.
     A                   Amaj7        A6            A
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
     F#(7)                     Bm
How amazingly unlikely is your birth,
    Bm                  D#dim7         A               F#(7)
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
               Bm         E7           A
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth.
