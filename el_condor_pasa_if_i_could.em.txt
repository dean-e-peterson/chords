El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could) (in Em)
 - music by Alomía Robles, based on Andean folk tunes, and maybe Jorge Milchberg
 - English lyrics by Paul Simon


Bm  Em                         G
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail.
D     G      D    G        D      Em      Bm  Em
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would.  Hmm-mmm.

Bm  Em                        G
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail.
D     G           D    G        D      Em      Bm  Em  (Em/D)
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.  Hmm-mmm.


Bridge:
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away,
(Am7)  G           (D)      G    Bm
Like a swan that's here and gone.
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground,
   (Am7)     G          (D)     G
He gives the world it's saddest sound,
     D       Em     Bm  Em
It's saddest sound, hmm-mmm.


Bm  Em                        G
I'd rather be a forest than a street.
D     G      D    G        D      Em    Bm  Em
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would.

Bm  Em                               G
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet.
D     G           D    G        D     Em     Bm  Em
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.
