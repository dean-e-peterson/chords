Intro: Esus4  Aadd9  E

Asus4
Man and a woman lie in bed together
G?                  Asus4? or A2?
Tears on her pillow all week long
Asus4                                           G  Asus4  A
You can draw a straight line right between 'em

Asus4
And a boy and a girl take a ride down a back-street
G?                           Asus4? A2?
Have a little moment, make a big mistake
Asus4
He's thinking wedding, she's thinking doctor
G                                F#sus4  F#(m?)
Get them alone, they'll tell you

           G(maj7) ? (F#m??)    Bm (some downward progression from Bm)
Unchain my soul, set me free, I need deliverance given to me.
Em                                 F#sus4       F#
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,
           (Esus4? Aadd9 E)
Unchain my soul
(Esus4? Aadd9 E)
(Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul)

Cinder block houses line up like a freight train
All along the streets, every one of them looks the very same
Nine out of ten people barely pay the rent

Diamonds on the hand of a rich man in Jersey
Doesn't need you and he doesn't need me
He's in so deep, he could swim to Manhattan

Unchain my soul, set me free, I need some deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,

Unchain my soul, set me free, I need deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,
Unchain my soul

Some big-shot man takes a dive down Wall Street
He was looking for the easy life, got a big headache
?
They don't make no drug that'll take it away
E
He'll be saying,

F# or F#sus4
Unchain my, unchain my
Unchain my soul, set me free, I need some deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,

Unchain my soul, set me free, I need deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,

Unchain my soul, set me free, I need some deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,

Unchain my soul, set me free, I need deliverance given to me.
Too many things out of my control, waste no time,
Unchain my soul
(Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul)
...(let me go)...(Unchain it)...(Set me free)...(Unchain my soul)..
Too many things gotten out of control
Too many things getting out of control
Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul, Unchain my soul
Too many things gotten out of control
Ending chords:  Esus4  E
