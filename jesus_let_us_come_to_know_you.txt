Jesus Let Us Come To Know You
- by Michael Card

D      A      Bm      F#m
Jesus, let us come to know You
G      D       Em      A
Let us see You face to face
D         A        Bm      F#m
Touch us, hold us, use us, mold us
G    D      Em   A  D
Only let us live in You


D     A       Bm   F#m
Jesus draw us ever nearer
G       D       Em     A
Hold us in Your loving arms
D       A       Bm     F#m
Wrap us in your gentle presence
    G        D          Em    A  D
And when the end comes, bring us home
