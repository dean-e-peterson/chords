G       D    Em        Am                             Em                    D
A long, long time ago, I can still remember, how that music used to make me smile.
    G      D    Em                  Am                 C
And I knew if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance,
    Em              A7 (or C)   D
and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

    Em       Am              Em               Am
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver.
C        (Em)   Am         C                   D
Bad news on the doorstep;  I couldn't take one more step.
G       D        Em                 Am             C
I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride,
    G         D          Em               C       D7    G
But something touched me deep inside, the day the music died.

   G   C         G        D              G            C              G         D
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.
         G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye singin',
Em                        A7 (A7sus2 A7)     Em                        D7 (D7sus2 D7 D7sus4 D7 D7sus2 D7)
This'll be the day that I die.               This'll be the day that I die.

G                 Am                   C                 Am         Em           D7
Did you write the book of love, and do you have faith in God above, if the Bible tells you so?
G        D        Em                C               Am
Do you believe in rock 'n roll, can music save your mortal soul,
    Em               A7                D7
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?

        Em                  Am (or D7)             Em               Am (or D7)
Well, I know that you're in love with him, 'cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.
    C           G        Am             C                    D
You both kicked off your shoes.  Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.
        G      D       Em                    Am                   C
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck, with a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
    G      D     Em               C       D7    G C G D
But I knew I was out of luck, the day the music died.

(Chorus)  I started singin'...                  (from previous column...)

Now for ten years we've been on our own,        Oh, and there we were all in one place,
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,          A generation lost in space,
But that's not how it used to be.               With no time left to start again.
When the jester sang for the king and queen,    So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick!
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean,          Jack flash sat on a candlestick
And a voice that came from you and me,          Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

Oh, and while the king was looking down,        Oh, and as I watched him on the stage,
The jester stole his thorny crown.              My hands were clenched in fists of rage.
The courtroom was adjourned;                    No angel born in hell,
No verdict was returned.                        Could break that satan's spell.
And while lennon read a book of Marx,           And as the flames climbed high into the night,
The quartet practiced in the park,              To light the sacrificial rite,
And we sang dirges in the dark,                 I saw satan laughing with delight,
The day the music died.                         The day the music died.

(Chorus)  We were singing...                    (Chorus)  He was singing...

Helter skelter in a summer swelter.             I met a girl who sang the blues,
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,      And I asked her for some happy news,
Eight miles high and falling fast.              But she just smiled and turned away.
It landed foul on the grass.                    I went down to the sacred store,
The players tried for a forward pass,           Where I'd heard the music years before,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.     But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume,        And in the streets: the children screamed,
While the sergeants played a marching tune.     The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
We all got up to dance,                         But not a word was spoken;
Oh, but we never got the chance!                The church bells all were broken.
`cause the players tried to take the field;     And the three men I admire most:
The marching band refused to yield.             The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost,
Do you recall what was revealed,                They caught the last train for the coast,
The day the music died?                         The day the music died.

(Chorus)  We started singing...                 (Chorus)  And they were singing...

(to next column...)                             (Final Chorus)
                                                They were singing, bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
                                                Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.
                                                Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, singin',
                                                This'll be the day that I die.
