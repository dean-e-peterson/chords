G        Ddim   Am7   D7
Say, its only a paper moon
Gsus4   D9     G  (D)    G
Sailing over a cardboard sea,
       Dm          Am7
But it wouldn't be make-believe
   D7  Am7   D7    G  Eb7  D7
If you believed in me.

G         Ddim   Am7    D7
Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Gsus4   D9     G (D)  G
Hanging over a muslin tree,
       Dm          Am7
But it wouldn't be make-believe
   D7  Am7   D7    G
If you believed in me.

    Am7 Eb   Bm
Without your love,
       Am7   D7     G
It's a honky-tonk parade.
    Am7 Eb   Bm
Without your love,
       G   Dm  E7          A9      D7+5  D7
It's a melody  played in a penny arcade.

G      Ddim       Am7    D7
It's a Barnum and Bailey world,
Gsus4   D9       G  (D) G
Just as phony as it can be,
       Dm          Am7
But it wouldn't be make-believe
   D7  Am7   D7     G  Am7  D7     (repeat from beginning)
If you believed in me.
                    G  Eb7  D7  G  (ending)
