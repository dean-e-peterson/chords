      F        Am   Bb           Am
I see trees of green, red roses, too.
Gm7        F    A7           Dm
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      Db             Gm7/C    C7        F    F+  BbMaj7  C7
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.


      F        Am  Bb              Am
I see skies of blue, and clouds of white,
Gm7                F  A7                Dm
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      Db             Gm7/C    C7        F    F+  BbMaj7  C7
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
    C7                   F
Are also on the faces of people going by.
      Dm              Am             Dm          Am
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
Dm             F#dim    Gm7  F#dim  Gm7    C7
They're really saying,  "I   love   you."  I hear...


F      Am Bb             Am
Babies cry, I watch them grow
Gm7                F   A7               Dm
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know,
      Db             Gm7/C    C7        F    F+  BbMaj7  C7  F  Am7b5  D7
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

D7     Gm7            Gm7/C    C7b9      F  Bb6  F
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
