   F                               C7
My day in the hills has come to an end, I know.
  F                                 Gb
A star has come out to tell me it's time to go.
    C7                     F           C7                     F
But deep in the dark green shadows are voices that urge me to stay.
     Fm6                    Eb
So I pause and I wait and I listen
    C7                  F                              Gm    C7    F   C7
For one more sound, For one more lovely thing that the hills might say.

    F6         Fmaj7                  E(/F)
The hills are alive with the sound of music,
     F6/9            F6                  Bb/D   C
With songs they have sung for a thousand years.
C+  F6            Fmaj7                   E(/F)
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music,
   F/A            Bb/D       C6 C7   F (Bb F)
My heart wants to sing every song it hears.

   F7
My heart wants to
Bb            Bbdim        F/A        F/C           Bb   Bbdim  F
beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees.
   Bb             Bbdim       F/A        F/C          G7/D   G7-5 C      F/A
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze,
   Bb           Bbdim         F/A       F/C        Bb     Bbdim  F/A F/C
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over stones on its way,
   Dm  (Dm6)        Am            Dm          G7          C   C+
To sing through the night, like a lark who is learning to pray.


  F6        Fmaj7                  E(/F)
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely.
  F6/9        F6                     Bb Bbm
I know I will hear what I've heard before.
   F/C                Am                   Bb  Gm7
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music,
         Am   C7   F
And I'll sing once more.
