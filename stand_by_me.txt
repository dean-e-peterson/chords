Intro:  C  Am  F  G  C  
C
When the night has come
Am
And the land is dark
        F           G                C
And the moon is the only light we'll see
C
No, I won't be afraid,
      Am 
No, I won't be afraid
        F           G               C
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus:
C
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Am  
Oh, stand by me.
    F     G            C
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me.

If the sea that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,
I won't cry, I won't cry,
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus
