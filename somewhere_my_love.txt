Am7     (x02010)
Gdim    (xxx323)
D7b9    (x5454x) or (x54545) or (xx1212)?

G         (Gm G)
Somewhere, my love,
                  Gdim D7
There will be songs to sing,
Am7          D7
Although the snow
Am7        D7      G
Covers the hope of spring.

G       (Gm G)
Somewhere a hill
                 Gdim D7
Blossoms in green and gold,
Am7           D7
And there are dreams,
Am7           D7        G
All that your heart can hold.

C                            G
Someday we'll meet again, my love.
Bb                   F      Bb     D7
Someday whenever the spring breaks through.

G          (Gm G)
You'll come to me
             Gdim D7
Out of the long a-go,
Am7         D7
Warm as the wind,
Am7         D7      G
Soft as the kiss of snow.

G         (Gm G)
Till then, my sweet,
               Gdim D7
Think of me now and then.
Am7         D7
Godspeed my love,
Am7          D7   D7b9 G
'Til you are mine a -  gain.
