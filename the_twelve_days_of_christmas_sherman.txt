The Twelve Days of Christmas (Allan Sherman lyrics)
 - non-traditional

Note: "S" is Sherman, "C" is the chorus and "B" is both

S: On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me
   A Japanese transistor radio

C: On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: Green polka dot pajamas
C: And a Japanese transistor radio
S: (It's a Nakashuma)

C: On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A calendar book with the name of my insurance man
C: Green polka dot pajamas
   And a Japanese transistor radio
S: (It's the Mark 4 model - that's the one that's discontinued)

C: On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A simulated alligator wallet
C: A calendar book with the name of my insurance man
   Green polka dot pajamas
   And a Japanese transistor radio
S: (And it comes with a leatherette case with holes in it
    so you can listen right through the case)

C: On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A statue of a lady with a clock where her stomach ought to be
C: A simulated alligator wallet, 
   A calendar book with the name of my insurance man
   Green polka dot pajamas
   And a Japanese transistor radio
S: (And it has a wire with a thing on one end that you can stick in your ear
    and a thing on the other end you can't stick anywhere because it's bent)

C: On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A hammered aluminum nutcracker
   and all that other stuff
C: And a Japanese transistor radio

   On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A pink satin pillow that said "San Diego" with fringe all around it
   And all that other stuff
C: And a Japanese transistor radio

   On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: An indoor plastic birdbath
C: All that other stuff
S: And a Japanese transistor radio

C: On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A pair of teakwood showercloths
C: And a Japanese transistor radio

   On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
S: A chromium combination manicure, scissors and cigarette lighter
C: And a Japanese transistor radio

   On the eleventh day of christmas my true love gave to me
S: An automatic vegetable slicer that works when you see it on television
     but not when you get it home
C: And a Japanese transistor radio

S: On the twelfth day of Christmas although it may seem strange
   On the twelfth day of Christmas I'm going to exchange
   An automatic vegetable slicer that works when you see it on television
     but not when you get it home
C: A chromium combination manicure, scissors and cigarette lighter
S: A pair of teakwood showercloths
C: An indoor plastic birdbath
S: A pink satin pillow that said "San Diego" with fringe all around it
C: A hammered aluminum nutcracker
S: A statue of a lady with a clock where her stomach ought to be
C: A simulated alligator wallet
S: A calendar book with the name of my insurance man
C: Green polka dot pajamas
B: And a Japanese transistor radio
S: Merry Christmas, everybody!
