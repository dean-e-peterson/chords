 - needs work, just checking, possibly intro?


E        B7                           E
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,
          B7                     E
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,
  (E7)     A                         E
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,
               B7               E
Because you're mine, I walk the line.


A         E7                    A
I find it very, very easy to be true,
         E7                          A
I find myself alone when each day is through,
     (A7)   D                       A
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you,
               E7               A
Because you're mine, I walk the line.


D          A7                       D
As sure as night is dark and day is light,
           A7                      D
I keep you on my mind both day and night,
   (D7)  G                                D
And happiness I've known proves that it's right,
               A7               D
Because you're mine, I walk the line.


A            E7                     A
You've got a way to keep me on your side,
            E7                          A
You give me cause for love that I can't hide,
    (A7)  D                             A
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide,
               E7               A
Because you're mine, I walk the line.


E        B7                           E
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,
          B7                     E
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,
  (E7)     A                         E
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,
               B7               E
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
