Power of Two
 - words and Music: Emily Saliers, tenor range G2-C4 in C
                             Gadd5 (320033) G#dim (xx3434)
Infro:  C  G  F  C  G  F

C       G       F      C
Now the parking lot is empty
     G          F
Everyone's gone someplace
G          C             F          C
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed
  Dm                   F        G Gadd5
A cooler and a two-day suitcase
                C        F       C
Cause there's a place we like to drive
        Am7    Dm7
Way out in the country
G          C          F                C
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing
        Dm              F    G Gadd5
And your hand's upon my knee

    CHORUS:
             C           G
    So we're okay, we're fine
             F                 Gsus4
    Baby I'm here to stop your crying
    G             C                G
    Chase all the ghosts from your head
        (Gadd5)           F                    G
    I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
    G#dim            Am                    F
    Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
                         C                 G         F
    We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart
                  C          G           F
    Adding up the total of a love that's true
             G    Gadd5             C
    Multiply life by the power of two


You know the things I'm afraid of
I'm not afraid to tell
And if we ever leave a legacy
It's that we loved each other well
Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people
Trying on the treasures of youth
But a road that's fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash
And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth

   (CHORUS, replacing first word So with 'Cause?)

Emily:
G       C            F               C
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation
                         G         F
Something new instead of something old
G       C           F                   C
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface
         F C    Dm     F C    Dm     Dm C   Dm7
And it's fool's gold...Fool's gold...Fool's gold
Amy:
Make new friends but keep the old
But remember what is gold...what is gold...what is gold


Now we're talking bout a difficult thing
And your eyes are getting wet
I tookus for better and I took us for worse
Now don't you ever forget
Now the steel bars between me and a promise
Suddenly bend with ease
And the closer I'm bound in love to you
The closer I am to free

   (CHORUS, first word "So" again)
