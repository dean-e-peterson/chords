Tomorrow
 - by Martin Charnin and Charles Strouse, tenor range B2-E4 in G
 - from the musical Annie, originally in Eb?, though I saw sheet music in F.
 - chords based on those at tabs.ultimate-guitar.com, transposed up a step

When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely,
                    Bb        Bbmaj7    D7sus4   D7
I just stick out my chin, and grin, and say,     Oh!

The sun'll come out, tomorrow,
              B7sus4   B7    Em    Em7            G#maj7   D7sus4   D7
So you got to hang on 'til tomorrow, Come what may.
(Oh! I got to hang on 'til tomorrow, Come what may.   <-- words on a repeat?)
