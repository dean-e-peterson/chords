Our wassail cup is made of the rosemary tree,
And so is your beer of the best barley.

REFRAIN

We are not daily beggars that beg from door to door;
But we are neighbours' children, whom you have seen before.

REFRAIN

Call up the butler of this house, put on his golden ring.
Let him bring us up a glass of beer, and better we shall sing.

REFRAIN

We have got a little purse of stretching leather skin;
We want a little of your money to line it well within.

REFRAIN

Bring us out a table and spread it with a cloth;
Bring us out a mouldy cheese, and some of your Christmas loaf.

REFRAIN

God bless the master of this house, likewise the mistress too,
And all the little children, that round the table go.

REFRAIN

Good master and good mistress, while you're sitting by the fire,
Pray think of us poor children, who are wandering in the mire.
