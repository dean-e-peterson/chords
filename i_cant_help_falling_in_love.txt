 - D is original key, I think, tenor range A2-C#4 in D


Intro:  G  A  Bm  Em/G  D/A  A  D  A7



D    F#m/C# Bm Bm/A     G     D    A
Wise men    say,   only fools rush in,

    G A     Bm   G          D    A    D  A7
But I can't help falling in love with you.



D     F#m/C# Bm Bm/A         G  D A
Shall I      stay,  would it be a sin,
   G A     Bm   G          D    A    D
If I can't help falling in love with you.



BRIDGE:
F#m          C#7    F#m           C#7
Like a river flows, surely to the sea,

F#m           C#7        F#m                 Em  A7
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be.



D    F#m/C# Bm Bm/A        G     D    A
Take my     hand,  take my whole life too,

    G A     Bm   Em/G       D/A  A    D
For I can't help falling in love with you.   (2x last time)


(Repeat from bridge, singing last line of song twice)
