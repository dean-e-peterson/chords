     A                                     E(7)
Lullaby, and good night, with pink roses bedight,
     (D)        (Bm)         E           (E7)  A
With lilies o'erspread is my baby's wee, sweet head.
(A7)    D              A             E          A
Lay you down, now, and rest, may thy slumber be blessed!
(A7)    D              A             E7         A
Lay you down, now, and rest, may thy slumber be blessed!

     A                                          E(7)
Lullaby, and good night, you're your mother's delight,
        (D      (Bm)     E   (E7) A
Shining angels beside my darling abide.
(A7)     D            A               E                  A
Soft and warm is your bed, close your eyes and rest your head.
(A7)     D            A               E7                 A
Soft and warm is your bed, close your eyes and rest your head.

      A                                            E(7)
Sleepyhead, close your eyes; mother's right here beside you.
        (D)           (Bm)           E     (E7) A
I'll protect you from harm, you will wake in my arms.
(A7)     D          A              E           A
Guardian angels are near, so sleep on, with no fear.
(A7)     D          A              E7          A
Guardian angels are near, so sleep on, with no fear.

     A                                         E(7)
Lullaby, and sleep tight.  Hush! My darling is sleeping,
       (D)             (Bm)            E       (E7) A
On his sheets white as cream, with her head full of dreams.
(A7)     D                 A              E               A
When the sky's bright with dawn, she will wake in the morning.
(A7)     D              A               E7            A
When noontide warms the world, she will frolic in the sun.
