   G
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,
                          (Gmaj7)     C6
to ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
   G
To work in the service of life and living,
                                      C6
In search of the answers of questions unknown
      G
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,
                          Dm(7)
Part of beginning to understand,


(Chorus)
C               G
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    C                  G
The things that you've shown us,
    D            G
The stories you tell,
C              G
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    C            G             D           G
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       D     C   G
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...

G                                    (Gmaj7)
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you,
                             (Gmaj7)     C6
To light up the darkness and show us the way,
    G
For though we are strangers in your silent world,
                                           C6
To live on the land we must learn from the sea,
      G
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell,
                                Dm(7)
Joyful and loving in letting it be,


(Chorus)
C               G
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    C                  G
The things that you've shown us,
    D           G
The stories you tell,
C              G
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    C            G             D           G
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       D     C   G
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...
