Intro:  C/E    E+    F  F/E  Dm7  G7

C                      G7
Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger,
C                    E+         Fmaj7   F6
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
    C6/E        Dm7 G7 Dm    E7        Am  C7/G  F
And somehow you know,    you know even then
     C/E              Dm7            G7  Cmaj7  C7  C+  Cdim/G
That somewhere you'll see her again and again.

C                      G7
Some enchanted evening someone may be laughing,
C                       E+         Fmaj7   F6
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
    C6/E        Dm7 G7 Dm   E7            Am  C7/G  F
And night after night,   as strange as it seems
    C/E          Dm7                 G7     C
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

G7sus  G7    Cmaj9 C    Dm7     G7       C6 C
Who    can explain it?  Who can tell you why?
G7sus  G7       Cmaj9 C    Am7      D7    G  Cm6  Edim  Dm7/G  Cdim/G
Fools  give you reas- ons, wise men never try.

C                      G7
Some enchanted evening when you find your true love,
C                        E+         Fmaj7   F6
When you feel her call you across a crowded room,
     C6/E       Dm7 G7 Dm    E7            Am  C7/G  F
Then fly to her side,    and make her your own
   C/E              Dm           Dm7/G     G7 C
Or all through your life you may dream all a- lone.

G7sus  G7       Cmaj9 C    Dm7   G7      C6 C
Once   you have found her, never let her go.
G7sus  G7       Cmaj9 C    Dm7/G         C
Once   you have found her, never let her go.
