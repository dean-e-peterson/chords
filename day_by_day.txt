B7     E                         A     A6
Day by day and with each passing moment,
           B7                     E   B7
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
         E                     A       A6
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
        B7                     E
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
                                    A      A6
He's whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
        (F#m)   B7                E   B7
Gives unto each day what He deems best,
      E                        A       A6
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
         B7                  E
Mingling toil with peace and rest.


B7   E                       A      A6
Everyday the Lord Himself is near me,
       B7                     E   B7
With a special mercy for each hour;
       E                            A       A6
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
         B7                    E
He whose name is Counselor and Power.
                                A       A6
The protection of His child and treasure,
     (F#m)       B7            E   B7
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
        E                              A      A6
"As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
         B7              E
This the pledge to me He made.


B7      E                  A     A6
Help me then in every tribulation,
      B7                    E   B7
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord.
       E                           A      A6
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
        B7                 E
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
                                    A      A6
Help me Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
        (F#m)    B7              E   B7
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
       E                         A       A6
One by one, the day, the moments fleeting,
       B7                 E
'Til I reach the promised land.
