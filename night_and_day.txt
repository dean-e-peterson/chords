         Bbdim                   E7             (Note: Melody starts on an E.)
Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
         Bbdim  (Am)    E(7)
When the jungle shadows fall,
         Bbdim               E7
Like the tick-tick-tock of a stately clock
      Bbdim   (Am)       E(7)
As it stands against the wall,
         F7                    Bb
Like the drip-drip-drop of the rain drops
         F#7              B   Bm
When the summer shower is through,
     A               Gm6             Am        E7
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you.


(Am)      Fmaj7  E7       (E+) Amaj7  (A6)
Night and day,     you are the one;
     Fmaj7           E7            (E+) Amaj7  (A6)
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun;
        Ebm7b5        Dm7                       (<-- or F#m in place of Ebm7b5)
Whether near to me or far,
        C#m7             Cdim
It's no matter, darling, where you are,
  Bm7      E7  (E7#5)    A
I think of you night and day.


        Fmaj7  E7     (E+) Amaj7  (A6)
Day and night,   why is it so?
          Fmaj7           E7            (E+) Amaj7  (A6)
That this longing for you follows wherever I go;
       Ebm7b5            Dm7
In the roaring traffic's boom,
       C#m7          Cdim
In the silence of my lonely room,
  Bm7      E7  (E7#5)    A
I think of you night and day.


        C(maj7)          Amaj7
Day and night, under the hide of me;
           C(maj7)                              Amaj7     (A6)
There's an oh-such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me.
        Ebm7b5           Dm7
And its torment won't be through,
         C#m7            Cdim
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Bm7     E                A   (F7  A)
Day and night, night and day.
