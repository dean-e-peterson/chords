G                        C        G                    C              E     
Well I heard that you're leavin'. Gonna leave me far behind (so far behind). 
                             Am           D7                      G     
'Cause you found a brand new lover. You decided that I'm not your kind. 


     C                G         C              F                         C
So I pulled your name out of my Rolodex, and I tore all your pictures in two,
      E                               Am
and I burned down the malt shop where we used to go
       D7                     G
just because it reminds me of you (dippity dippity doo).


       F         G                  C            F             G              C
That's right you ain't gonna see me cryin'.  I'm glad that you found somebody new.
           F             E              Am               F
'Cause I'd rather spend eternity eating shards of broken glass,
     C              G           C
than spend one more minute with you


G                          C        G                              C     
I guess I might seem kinda bitter.  You got me feeling down in the dumps.
           E                         Am
'Cause I'm stranded all alone in the gas station of love,
      D7                           G
and I have to use the self-service pumps.


       F             G                  C        
Oh, so honey, let me help you with that suitcase.
    F           G                 C   
You ain't gonna break my heart in two.
           F            E       Am               F    
'Cause I'd rather get a 100,000 paper cuts on my face,
     C              G           C   
than spend one more minute with you. 


Am                      Em                         F               G              C   
I'd rather rip out my intestines with a fork, than watch you going out with other men. 
Am                 E            Am     D7                                      G    
I'd rather slam my fingers in a door, again and again and again and again and again. 
(Oh, can't you see what I'm tryin' to say, Darlin...)


    F              G                   C
I'd rather have my blood sucked out by leeches (leeches);
         F               G          C
shove an icepick under a toenail or two.
           F             E                          Am              F
I'd rather clean all the bathrooms in Grand Central Station with my tongue,
     C              G           C
than spend one more minute with you.


                     F          G            C
Yes, I'd rather jump naked on a huge pile of thumbtacks,
            F          G                 C
or stick my nostrils together with crazy glue.
           F           E                         Am                 F
I'd rather dive into a swimming pool filled with double-edged razor blades
     C              G           Am
than spend one more minute with you.


           F                            E
I'd rather rip my heart right out of my ribcage with my bare hands
         Am                                            Fm
and then throw it on the floor and stomp on it 'till I die...
     C              G           F   C
Than spend one more minute with you.
