     D     A        Bm   (Bm/A)
This is my Father's world,
    Em    D         A
And to my listening ears
(G) D      F#m        F#    F#7 Bm
All nature sings, and round me  rings
(Bm/A) G     A      D
The    music of the spheres.
     D     G A      D
This is my Father's world:
  G       Em     F#m  G
I rest me in the thought
(G) D         F#m       F#    F#7 Bm
Of  rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
(Bm/A) G        A       D
His    hand the wonders wrought.


     D     A        Bm   (Bm/A)
This is my Father's world,
    Em          D      A
The birds their carols raise,
(G) D       F#m        F# F#7 Bm
The morning light, the li-ly  white,
(Bm/A) G           A       D
De  -  clare their maker's praise.
     D     G A      D
This is my Father's world:

He shines in all that's fair;
(G)    D        F#m     F#   F#7 Bm
In the rustling grass I hear him pass;
(Bm/A) G            A    D
He     speaks to me everywhere.

  Em     D        A
O let me ne'er forget
(G)  D          F#m         F#  F#7 Bm
That though the wrong seems oft so  strong,
(Bm/A) G      A     D
God    is the ruler yet.
     D     G A      D
This is my Father's world:
    G         Em       F#m  G
Why should my heart be sad?
(G) D       F#m           F# F#7  Bm
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
(Bm/A) G               A        D
God    reigns; let the earth be glad!
