 - by Paul Simon, original key G?

Intro: G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4  G               Gsus4 (320013)

CHORUS:
G                                Em
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away.
             G                 D
You know the nearer your destination,
    C                D        G
The more you're slip sliding away.

         Em                       G
I know a man, he came from my hometown,
            Em              D            C            C7
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown.
          G                Em
He said Dolores, I live in fear,
            G            D
My love for you's so overpowering,
     C           D     G
I'm afraid that I will disappear.

(Chorus)

         Em              G
I know a woman, became a wife.
              Em             D         C               C7
These are the very words she uses to describe her life:
           G                     Em
She said a good day ain't got no rain.
           G                 D
She said a bad day is when I lie in the bed,
      C        D           G
And I think of things that might have been.

(Chorus)

             Em               G
And I know a father who had a son,
             Em               D               C                C7
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done.
          G                Em
He came a long way just to explain.
              G             D
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping,
        C                 D      G
Then he turned around and headed home again.

(Chorus)

       Em                            G
Whoah, God only knows, God makes his plan.
         Em          D               C          C7
The information's unavailable to the mortal man.
              G                     Em
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay,
              G                D
Believe we're gliding down the highway,
        C          D        G
When in fact we're slip sliding away.

(Chorus,  2x)
