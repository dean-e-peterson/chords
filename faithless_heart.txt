Faithless Heart
 - by Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith


   Dm                             G                C
At times the woman deep inside me wanders far from home,
    Dm                            G                C
And in my mind I live a life that chills me to the bone.
  F Dm7             C     G     C
A heart running for arms out of reach,
    Dm         C           G       F
But who is the stranger my longing seeks?
        Dm           G                     C
I don't know, but it scares me through and through,
              Dm              F              G
'Cause I've a man at home who needs me to be true.


CHORUS:
   C    G    F        C             G
Oh faithless heart be far away from me.
Am                                F               G
Playing games inside my head that no one else can see.
   C    G    F         C               G
Oh faithless heart you tempt me to the core,
    Am                              F           G        C
But you can't have a hold on me, so don't come around anymore.


Dm                                  G              C
God you know my feelings here could wipe my world away,
Dm                      G                   C
Ravaging the promises a stronger heart once made,
   F Dm7       C   G  G   C
So hold me I'm falling so fast,
    Dm               C          G         F
And tell me that the fighting inside will pass.
     Dm            G                    C
As I walk away and find the strength to choose
            Dm           F                   G
The man who waits for me with a heart that's true.


CHORUS:
   C    G    F        C             G
Oh faithless heart be far away from me.
Am                                F               G
Playing games inside my head that no one else can see.
   C    G    F         C               G
Oh faithless heart you tempt me to the core,
    Am                              F           G        C
But you can't have a hold on me, so don't come around anymore.


(Repeat chorus)
     Am                              F           G       C
Well you can't have a hold on me, so don't come around.
