Hallelujah, What a Savior! (Man of Sorrows)
 - words and music Philip P. Bliss
 - a couple chords from The Other Song Book, the rest from Dean

C       Em/B      Am     E
"Man of Sorrows!" what a name
               G/D
F       C      D   D7  G
For the Son of God who came

C      Em/B    Am   F
Ruined sinners to reclaim.
            F
     C G    Am     F  F/E  F/D  C
Hallelujah! What a Savior!


C       Em/B      Am       E
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
F     C        D      D7 G
In my place condemned He stood;
C      Em/B      Am       F
Sealed my pardon with His blood;
     C G    Am     F  F/E  F/D  C
Hallelujah! What a Savior!


C       Em/B      Am       E
Guilty, vile, and helpless we:
F        C       D   D7  G
Spotless Lamb of God was He:
C      Em/B       Am     F
"Full atonement!" can it be?
     C G    Am     F  F/E  F/D  C
Hallelujah! What a Savior!


C      Em/B   Am    E
Lifted up was He to die;
F      C          D   D7  G
"It is finished!" was His cry;
C      Em/B    Am     F
Now in heaven exalted high;
     C G    Am     F  F/E  F/D  C
Hallelujah! What a Savior!


C       Em/B       Am       E
When He comes, our glorious King,
F       C        D    D7 G
All His ransomed home to bring,
C     Em/B     Am         F
Then anew this song we'll sing:
     C G    Am     F  F/E  F/D  C
Hallelujah! What a Savior!
