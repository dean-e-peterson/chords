        E7
        We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files.
        A
        We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.
        D               G               C           Am
        Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes.
        E7                          D               D7
        Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home,

        (CHORUS)

        E7
        Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes,
        A
        Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes.
        D             G                C            Am
        It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair.
        E7                        D                D7
        Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids.

        D7           G          Em
        Koo koo ka choo, Mrs. Robinson... (CHORUS)

        E7
        Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon,
        A
        Going to the candidates debate.
        D               G               C                  Am
        Laugh about it, shout about it, when you've got to choose.
        E7                         D   D7
        Any way you look at it you lose.


        D7             G           Em
        Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
          G                Em             C    (Am)     D
        A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  Woo woo woo.
        D               G         Em
        What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson.
        G               Em             C             Am           E7
        Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.  Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.
