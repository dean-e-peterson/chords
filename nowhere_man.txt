Nowhere Man
 - by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, tenor range E3-E4(A4) in E
 - chords from Hal Leonard Beatles fake book

E           B
He's a real nowhere man,
A              E
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
A              Am                E
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
E              B
Doesn't have a point of view,
A                    E
Knows not where he's going to,
A          Am               E
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

        G#m        A
Nowhere Man please listen,
          G#m              A
You don't know what you're missing,
        G#m      F#m                       B
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command!

Instrumental:  E  B  A  E  ?

E                B
He's as blind as he can be,
A                 E
Just sees what he wants to see,
A               Am            E
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

        G#m        A
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
          G#m         A
Take your time, don't hurry,
         G#m      F#m                             B
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand!

E              B
Doesn't have a point of view,
A                    E
Knows not where he's going to,
A          Am               E
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

        G#m        A
Nowhere Man please listen,
          G#m              A
You don't know what you're missing,
        G#m      F#m                       B
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command!

E           B
He's a real Nowhere Man,
A              E
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
A              Am                E
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
A              Am                E
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
A              Am                E
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody!
