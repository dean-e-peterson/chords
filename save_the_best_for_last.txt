(D)            A          Gadd9   D/F#
Sometimes the snow comes down in June,
               Gadd9     A         Bm
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon,
           A       Gadd9   D/F#
I see the passion in your eyes,
               Gadd9 A      D
Sometimes its all a big surprise.

                    Gadd9           D/F#              Em7      A7       D
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish you'd tell me this was love.
              Am7            G/B                 Cadd9  G/B  A
It's not the way I hoped, or how I planned, but somehow its enough.

              A        G       D/F#
And now we're standing face to face,
            Gadd9  A      Bm
Isn't this world a crazy place.
             A           Gadd9      D/F#
Just when I thought our chance had passed,
            G        A         G  D  C6/9 G D
You go and save the best for last.


            A          Gadd9   D/F#
All of the nights you came to me,
                 Gadd9    A       Bm
When some silly girl had set you free.
              A         Gadd9   D/F#
You wondered how you'd make it through,
            Gadd9    A          D
I wondered what was wrong with you.

                      Gadd9             D/F#              Em7        A7          D
'Cause how could you give your love to someone else, and share your dreams with me.
               Am7               G/B                Cadd9     G/B       A
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for is the one thing you can't see.

              A        G       D/F#
But now we're standing face to face,
            Gadd9   A     Bm
Isn't this world a crazy place.
             A           Gadd9      D/F#
Just when I thought our chance had passed,
            Gadd9    A        D
You go and save the best for last.
