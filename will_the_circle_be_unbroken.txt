Chorus:

         G                 G7
Will the circle be unbroken
       C                G
by and by, Lord, by and by.
                              (Em)
There's a better home a-waiting
       (G)        D (D7) G    C  G
in the sky, Lord, in the sky.


      I was standing by the window
      one dark and cloudy day,
      when I saw that hearse come rolling
      for to carry my mother away

Chorus

      Well, I told the undertaker:
      "Undertaker, please drive slow,
       for this body that you're hauling,
       Lord, I hate to see her go !"

Chorus

      Well, I followed close behind her,
      tried to hold up and be brave.
      But I could not hide my sorrow
      when they layed her in the grave.

Chorus


      I went home, my home was lonely
      Now my mother she has gone
      All my brothers, sisters crying
      What a home so sad and alone.

Chorus
