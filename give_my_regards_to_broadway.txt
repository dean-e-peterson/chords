Did you ever see two Yankees
Part upon a foreign shore,
When the good ship's just about to
Start for Old New York once more?

With teardimmed eye they say goodbye,
They're friends without a doubt;
When the man on the pier
Shouts, "Let them clear", as the ship strikes out.


(Chorus)
A       C#m7 A     Adim Bm7  E7                (substitute Amaj7 for C#m7?)
Give my re - gards to   Broadway,
  Bm7          E7 E+  A6 Bbdim E7
Remember me to Herald Square,
A        C#m7 A    Am6 E  B7 E      Cdim
Tell all the  gang at  Forty Second street,
C#m  F#m F#m7 B6   B7 E Dm6 E
That I   will soon be there;

A       C#m7 A   Adim Bm7  E7
Whisper of   how I'm  yearning,
   Bm7             E7  E+   A    Amaj7 A7
To mingle with the old time throng,
F#7       F#+   F#7 Bm  F#7  Bm7
Give my regards to  old Broadway
        F7   A  F#m  B7    E7   A    (to repeat: Adim  Bm7  E7+)
And say that I'll be there 'ere long.


Say hello to dear old Coney Isle,
If there you chance to be,
When you're at the Waldorf
Have a smile and charge it up to me;

Mention my name every place you go,
As 'round the town you roam;
Wish you'd call on my gal,
Now remember, old pal when you get back home.

(Chorus some more)

(Alternate beginning lyrics I saw, at kididdles.com:)
At a port in France one morning, waiting for my ship to sail,
Yankee soldiers on a furlough came to get the latest mail;
I told them I was on my way to old Manhattan Isle;
They all gathered about, as the vessel pulled out, and said, with a smile:
Give my regards to Broadway...
