Gadd5? (320033)    G (320003)    Asus4 (x02230)

D            Gadd5                Asus4  A  (G)
Where is the moment we needed the most?
D               G                       A
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost.
Bm                F#m                G
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray.
                  D               Em
They tell me your passion's gone away,
            G (or Em7)       Asus4  A
And I don't need no carryin' on.

You stand in the line just to hit a new low.
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go.
You tell me your life's been way off line.
You're falling to pieces every time,
And I don't need no carryin' on.

CHORUS:
(A)                   D                      Bm (?)
Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down,
               G                     A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around.
                  D                       Bm
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie,
              G                      A
You work at a smile and you go for a ride.
              Bm                    Bm/A
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie,
                   G                          D
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind.
              Em7  Asus4     A         D   (Gadd5  Asus4  A)
You had a bad day.       You had a bad day.

Bm              F#m          G
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
                  D (or Bm)         Em
The point is they laugh at what you say
            G (or Em7)       Asus4  A
And I don't need no carryin' on.

CHORUS:
You had a bad day, you're taking one down,
You sing a sad song just to turn it around.
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie,
You work at a smile and you go for a ride.
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie,
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind.
              G                               (A)
You had a bad day.  (Oooh...what a holiday...)

BRIDGE:
F                                               Bb               (Bbmaj7 Bb)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink, and the whole thing turns out wrong.
    F                                                   Bb
You might not make it back, and you know that you could be, well oh that strong.
            Asus4       A
And I'm not wrong.  (Yeah...)

D               Gadd5                        Asus4  A       (G) D
So where is the passion when you need it the most?  Oh, you and I,
D               G                       Asus4  A
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost.

CHORUS:
Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down,
You sing a sad song just to turn it around.
You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie,
You work at a smile and you go for a ride.
              Bm                        Bm/A
You had a bad day, you've seen what you like,
                G                 D
And how does it feel for one more time?
              Em7  Asus4     A         D  (Gadd5  Asus4  A  G  D)
You had a bad day.       You had a bad day.
