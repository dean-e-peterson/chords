On the day that you were born the angels got together and
  F#m                          B11  B9
Decided to create a dream come true.
        Gadd9               G               Gmaj7
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold 
              G6              A
And starlight in your eyes of blue.


        Gmaj7                       F#7sus  F#7 
That is why all the girls(/boys) in town

Follow you all around.

Just like me,    they long to be     close to you.             (repeat & fade)
