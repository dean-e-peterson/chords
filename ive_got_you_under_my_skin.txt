A7    Em7    A7           Dmaj7 Bm7
I've got you    under my skin;
A7    Em7    A7              Dmaj7       Bm7
I've got you    deep in the heart of me,
D   Em7             A7                Dmaj7       Bm7
So deep in my heart   you're nearly a part of me;
F#m  Em7     A7           Dmaj7 D6
I've got you    under my skin.


A7   Em7      A7             Dmaj7 D6
I've tried so    not to give in;
   Gm6       G/b        A7    C#          Dmaj7  D6
I said to myself, "This affair  never can go so well."
     C#m7-5              F#7                    Fdim     B
But  why should I try to resist, when Darling I know so well
     G6  Gm   A7          Dmaj7 D6
I've got you    under my skin.


BRIDGE:
     A6                  A7
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might,
         D      Gdim        D7
For the sake of having you near,
    D6           G                 Gm
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
         D         Cdim         A7
That repeats and repeats in my ear,


            Bm                G     A7        D
"Don't you know, little fool,  you never can win?
Fdim         Em7     G/B      A7       D         A+
Use your mentality  -    wake up to reality."
     D          G               Gm
But each time I do, just the thought of you
          D     Am       B7
Makes me stop before I begin -
[n.c.]      Em7      A7-9          D      D6
'Cause I've got you      under my skin,
     Em7     G/B A7       D     Gdim    D
I've got you    under my skin.
