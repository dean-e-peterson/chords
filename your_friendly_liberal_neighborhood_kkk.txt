[Intro]
(C)                                                                           (G7)                  
Is there a klavern in your town? (In your town.)  If not, then why not have us down? (Have us down.) 


[Verse 1]
       C         (C7)                F              F#dim
You'll never recognize us, there's a smile upon our face
      C                A7                 D7              G7
We're changin' all our dirty sheets and a-cleanin' up the place
     C              C7           F                F#dim
Yep, since we got a lawyer and a public relations man
           C         A7       D7           G7      C    (C7)
We're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan


[Chorus]
                F                  F#dim                C
Yes, we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
     C                 A7              D7               G7
Ever since we got that lawyer and that public relations man
          C               C7          F             F#dim
Course we did shoot one reporter, but he was just obscene
        C                A7                      D7    G7    C
And you can't call us no filthy names, what does Anglo-Saxon mean?


[Post-Chorus]
C               F         F#dim      C (NC)
Allemande left, allemande right, the Ladies' Auxiliary is meetin' tonight
           C                F       F#dim     C (NC)
'Cause the Klan's collected so much cash that now, by gum, we're rich white trash


[Verse 2]
           C                (C7)              F            F#dim
Now, we've heard it said our leadership's not qualified to lead
          C                A7                   D7                G7
Well, I'm tellin' you that just ain't true, why three of them can read
         C             C7          F                     F#dim
Take our Grand Exalted Dragon, now some folks think he's bad
               C        E7        A7             D7       G7        C
But you should meet his sweet old mother and her brother, who's his dad


[Chorus]
    (C7)          F                  F#dim                C
Yes, they're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
         C             A7               D7              G7
And he's gonna run for governor soon as he's out of the can
      C                 C7            F                  F#dim
We're all from fine old families, the pride of all these hills
     C         A7             D7     G7    C
Yep, seven generations at the same illegal stills


[Post-Chorus]
C                      F     F#dim  C (NC)
Had a little rally the other night, shot up town in a fury
C                F       F#dim          C (NC)
Luke's arrested, Pa's on trial, and the rest of us are on the jury


[Verse 3]
           C                 (C7)                 F                 F#dim
Now, we've heard them call us deadbeats, and we'd like to say we're not
      C                A7                 D7                  G7
We'll all stand on our record, and that's one thing we've all got
       C              C7              F                  F#dim
And we only have that arsenal so that you won't raise no fuss
           C         (E7)        A7                        D7      G7          C
And if you don't like that, then call the cops, 'cause the chances are they're us


[Chorus]
    (C7)        F                  F#dim                C
Yes, we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
    C               A7            D7            G7
But somehow we went from the fire to the fryin' pan
   C                C7                 F                F#dim
We never learned to hold a job, and we never learned to write
    C                 A7                           D7       G7    C
But boy, we sure have learned the ropes, 'cause we use them every night


[Bridge 1]
          C                   F         F#dim       C (NC)
Now, when Congress calls you, don't get stuck, just start confessin' and pass the buck
    C                            F                 F#dim        C (NC)
The Klubb blames the Klaxon, the Klaxon blames the Kleagle, the Kleagle blames the Grand Imperial Eagle
    C                            F                 F#dim       C (NC)
The Eagle blames the Wizard, the Wizard blames the Dragon, the Dragon takes the blame, but he's just braggin'


[Verse 4]
           C              (C7)                 F              F#dim
Now, we're out to show the Congress that we're oh so nice and meek
       C          A7                        D7                  G
Why we never even take the Fifth, 'cause we drank that all last week
           C             C7          F              F#dim
And you'll never hear us shootin' or hangin' people high
             C       (E7) A7                     D7      G7 C
'Cause we're learnin' to  respect the law and to have an alibi


[Bridge 2]
         C                           C                             G7   
(Oh, oh, come, come, come, come...)  Come to the church in the wildwood 
                              C  C7
Oh, come to the church in the vale (And, those dirty, lyin' witnesses, Lord, forgive them what they speak)
   F          F#dim      C
No spot is so dear to my childhood (We would go to church and pray for them, 'cept we blew it up last week)


[Outro]
                F                  F#dim                C
Yes, we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
       C                  A7              D7               G7
And we sure do thank that lawyer and that public relations man
         C             C7                  F                F#dim
So we're sorry that we hung them, but they did have quite a tan
       C                  F#dim              C       A7
And it sure confused your friendly, liberal, misunderstood
     D7                    G7   (or asks) C                       A7
Your friendly neighborhood Klan who says, "What's wrong with the hood?"
     D7                 G7                                                               C7
Your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux (Grab your Cadillac and head for the hills)
