B7     E                    A
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go,
    E                A
I'm standing here outside the door
  E                A             B7
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye.
        E                      A
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn',
E                        A
The Taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn.
  E            F#m(or A)        B7
Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

           E           A
        So kiss me and smile for me,
        E                   A
        Tell me that you'll wait for me,
        E                F#m          B(sus4)  B7
        Hold me like you never let me go.
                   E       A
        'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,
        E               A                 E
        Don't know when I'll be back again.
           F#m             B7
        Oh babe, I hate to go.


B7         E               A
There's so many times I've let you down,
   E               A
So many times I've played around,
  E            A                 B7
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
      E               A
Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,
      E             A
Ev'ry song I sing I sing for you.
     E                F#m(or A)          B7
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.

        So kiss me ...


E                A
Now the time has come to leave you,
E             A
One more time let me kiss you,
     E                A             B7
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
E               A
Dream about the days to come,
     E               A
When I won't have to leave alone,
 E              F#m(or A)       B7
About the times I won't have to say.

        Kiss me ...
