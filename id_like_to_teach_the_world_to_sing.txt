    D                                  E
I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love,
     A                             G                 D
Grow apple trees and honeybees and snow-white turtle doves.
                                       E
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.
    A                              G             D
I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company.

    D                                  E
I'd like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand,
    A                                    G                    D
And hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land.
