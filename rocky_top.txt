Rocky Top
 - words and music by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant

G               C      G          Em          D        G
Wish that I was on old Rocky Top, down in the Tennesse hills.
                C        G          Em       D         G
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top, ain't no telephone bills.

G            C       G          Em            D          G
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top, half bear the other half cat,
                    C        G         Em      D           G
Wild as a mink, but sweet as soda pop, I still dream about that.


(Chorus)
Em                D         F                   C
Rocky Top, you'll always be home, sweet home to me.
         G                      F    G                 F    G
Good old Rocky Top.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.


G                  C           G          Em            D         G
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top, looking for a moonshine still.
                     C         G          Em          D     G
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top, reckon they never will.

G                  C      G          Em         D        G
Corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top, dirt's too rocky by far.
                   C        G          Em        D           G
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top, get their corn from a jar.


(Chorus)
Em                D         F                   C
Rocky Top, you'll always be home, sweet home to me.
         G                      F    G                 F    G
Good old Rocky Top.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.


G                 C          G          Em             D         G
I've had years of cramped up city life, trapped like a duck in a pen.
              C      G          Em       D       G
All I know is it's a pity, life can't be simple again.


(Chorus)
Em                D         F                   C
Rocky Top, you'll always be home, sweet home to me.
         G                      F    G                 F    G
Good old Rocky Top.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.  Rocky Top, Tennessee.
