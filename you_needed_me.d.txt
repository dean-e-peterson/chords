A7        D                  G
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry,
         A7                    D
I was confused, you cleared my mind,
                    D7        G
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me,
            E7              A
And held me up, and gave me dignity,
            A7
Somehow you needed me.

(A7)        D                  G
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            A7                    D
To face the world, out on my own again.
                  D7   G      G#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   D                F#7    Bm  E7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    A7             D           F#7
You needed me, you needed me.

    (F#7) Bm                  D
    And I can't believe it's you,
                G            D
    I can't believe it's true.
      Em7       A7            D     F#7
    I needed you and you were there.
             Bm                D                   G        D
    And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
                E7                                A7
    'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares.

(A7)        D                G
You held my hand when it was cold.
           A7               D
When I was lost you took me home
                      D7    G
You gave me hope when I was at the end,
              E7             A
And turned my lies back into truth again,
         A7
You even called me "friend".

(A7)        D                  G
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            A7                    D
To face the world, out on my own again.
                  D7   G      G#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   D                F#7    Bm  E7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    A7             D        B7
You needed me, you needed me.
    E7      A7     D        B7  Em7  A7sus4  A7  D
You needed me, you needed me.
