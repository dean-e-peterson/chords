Memories
 - from the musical Cats, by Andrew Lloyd Webber

C                             Am
Daylight - See the dew on the sunflower,
                   F                      Em
And a rose that is fading, roses whither away.
         Dm                            Am
Like the sunflower, I yearn to turn my face to the dawn,
     G               C
I am waiting for the day.

C                               Am
Midnight - not a sound from the pavement.
                      F                       Em
Has the moon lost her memory, she is smiling alone.
       Dm                                Am
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet,
        G              C
And the wind begins to moan.

C                         Am
Memory - all alone in the moonlight.
                   F                         Em
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then.
    Dm                          Am
I remember the time I knew what happiness was.
        G            C
Let the memory live again.

Em           Dm    Em         Dm   Em  C  D   G
Every street light seems to beat a fatalistic warning.
Em      Am              D          Bm
Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters,
    Em      A       D
And soon it will be morning.

C                             Am
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise.
                  F                            Em
I must think of a new life, and I mustn't give in.
         Dm                           Am
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too,
      G              C
And a new day will begin.

Em             Dm Em           Dm  Em         C     D  G
Burnt out ends of smokey days, the stale cold smell of morning.
    Em         Am            D        Bm                        (<--chords?)
The streetlamp dies, another night is over,
    Em      A       D                                           (<--chords?)
Another day is dawning.

C                         Am
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
                   F                        Em
All alone with the memory of my days in the sun.
       Dm                               Am
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is.
        G             C
Look, a new day has begun.
