Trailer for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents,
G            C            D7  (n.c.)
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes, ah but...
G            C                   D7               G
Two hours of pushing broom buys a eight by twelve fourbit room,
     G7      C                D7            G
I'm a man of means by no means, King of the Road.

Third box car midnight train, destination Bangor, Maine,
G            C             D7  (n.c.)
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues, I smoke...
G           C           D7                   G
Old stogies I have found, short, but not too big around,
     G7      C                D7            G
I'm a man of means by no means, King of the Road.

I know every engineer on every train,
E7                      A
All of the children and all of their names,
A                    D
And every handout in every town,
    E7  (n.c.)
And ev'ry lock that ain't locked when no one's around, I sing...
