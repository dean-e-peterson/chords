Intro:  D  Dsus4  D  Gmaj7/B  G6/B  D  Dsus4  G6/B

                    Em7         G
Spend all your time waiting for that second chance,
        D               Bm       A
For the break that will make it okay.
                    Em7            G
There's always some reason to feel not good enough,
         D           G          A
And it's hard at the end of the day.
               Em7          G
I need some distraction, oh beautiful release,
D        Bm           A
Memories seep from my veins.
          Em7       G
Let me be empty and weightless and maybe,
     D         Dsus2   Asus4  A7
I'll find some peace tonight.

       D                       F#m
In the arms of the angel, fly away from here,
          G                              D                    A  A7
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear.
        D      Dsus2    D       Dsus2    F#m
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie,
              G    Gsus4  G             D  A              D
You're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here.

(D)  Dsus4  D  Gmaj7/B  G6/B  D  Dsus4  G6/B


                Em7                G
So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn,
        D            Bm              A
There's vultures and thieves at your back.
                   Em7                   G
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies,
         D           G            A
That you make up for all that you lack.
                 Em7           G
It don't make no difference, escaping one last time,
     D   Bm      A
It's easier to believe.
              Em7              G
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness,
     D         Dsus2  Asus4  A7
That brings me to my  knees.

       D                       F#m
In the arms of the angel, fly away from here,
          G                              D                    A  A7
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear.
        D      Dsus2    D       Dsus2    F#m
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie,
              G    Gsus4  G              D  A              D    Dsus4   D
You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort here.
              G    Gsus4  G              D  A              D
       In the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort here.
