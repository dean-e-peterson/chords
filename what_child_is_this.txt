What child is this who laid to rest,        on Mary's lap is sleeping?

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,    while shepherds watch are keeping?

Am                  G                  (Abdim) Am     Dm      E
Why lies He in such mean estate,         where ox and ass are feeding?
     Am                  G             (Abdim) Am     E       (Asus4) Am
Good Christian fear, for sinners here,     the silent Word is pleading:

Em     C           G                   (Abdim) Am       Dm        E
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,     the cross be borne for me, for you.
Em    C        G                       (Abdim) Am        E      (Asus4) Am
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,            the Babe, the Son of Mary.


Am                    G                (Abdim) Am       Dm      E
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,    come peasant, king to own Him.
    Am               G                 (Abdim) Am     E       (Asus4) Am
The King of Kings salvation brings,        let loving hearts enthrone Him.

Em     C       G                       (Abdim) Am     Dm        E
Raise, raise a song on high,               the virgin sings her lullaby.
Em   C       G                         (Abdim) Am        E      (Asus4) Am
Joy, joy for Christ is born,               the Babe, the Son of Mary.
