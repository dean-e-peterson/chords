Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you.
Am     G     Am G        Am G      Am  (D) Gadd5
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new.
C    D(add9)  Bm   C              D(add9)  Bm  Bm7
Flashback,    warm nights, almost left   behind.
C   D(add9)  Bm  C           D
Suitcase of  memories.  Time after...

Am  G         Am      G       Am  G       Am (D) Gadd5
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead.
Am     G       Am G     Am    G         Am (D) Gadd5
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said.

Then you say,     go slow, I fall   behind.

The second   hand unwinds.

If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me time after time.
       D                                   Em   C    D     G
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting, time after time.

Af-ter my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray.
Am   G           Am G            Am    G      Am (D) Gadd5
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK.

Secrets     stolen from deep   inside.

The drum beats out of time.
