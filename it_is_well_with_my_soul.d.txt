It Is Well With My Soul (in D)
 - Lyrics by H. G. Spafford, music by Phillip P. Bliss, tenor range E3-E4 in D

Intro: D  (D7)  G  F#m  Em  A  D  (or D G D A D)

     D              A   D Em A       D
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
F#m  Bm           E           A
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
A7  D       G         (B7) E            A
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
A7    D     D/F# G  D/A   A       D
It is well, it   is well, with my soul.

       D               A    D      Em A          D
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
F#m  Bm           E          A
Let  this blest assurance control,
A7   D            G     (B7) E          A
That Christ has regarded my  helpless estate,
A7       D    D/F# G   D/A   A      D
And hath shed His  own blood for my soul.

Refrain:
      A        (Asus4 A)              D          (Dsus4 D)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (D7) G     F#m   Em    A       D  (alternate chords)
       G           D     A       D
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.


   D                  A  D    Em  A    D
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
F#m Bm          E            A
My  sin, not in part but the whole,
A7 D             G      (B7)  E          A
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
A7         D     D/F#   G   D/A   A    D
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

    D                 A  D  Em     A        D
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
F#m Bm      E             A
If  Jordan above me shall roll,
A7 D             G     (B7)   E           A
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
A7        D   D/F# G   D/A   A     D
Thou wilt whisper  Thy peace to my soul.

Refrain:
      A        (Asus4 A)              D          (Dsus4 D)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (D7) G     F#m   Em    A       D  (alternate chords)
       G           D     A       D
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.


     D                    A   D   Em A      D
But, Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
F#m  Bm           E             A
The  sky, not the grave, is our goal;
A7  D            G     (B7) E            A
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
A7      D     D/F# G  D/A  A     D
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

    D                   A    D  Em    A        D
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
F#m  Bm               E         A
The  clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
A7  D             G      (B7)    E            A
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
A7   D   D/F# G  D/A  A       D
Even so, it   is well with my soul.

Refrain:
      A        (Asus4 A)              D          (Dsus4 D)
It is well, (it is    well,)  with my soul, (with my    soul,)
  (D7) G     F#m   Em    A       D  (alternate chords)
       G           D     A       D
It is  well, it is well, with my soul.
(D7) G     F#m   Em    A       D
