The Sound of Silence
 - by Paul Simon
 - Probably actually in Dm, but I didn't like the Bb's.  4/4? ~105bpm?

(You can alternate Am with A2 and G with G2)

Am                     G 
Hello darkness, my old friend, 
                           Am 
I've come to talk with you again, 
          C          F       C 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
                        F        C 
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping, 
        F               (Dm7)         C                  Am C
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains,     
           G        Am 
Within the sound of silence. 

                             G 
In restless dreams I walked alone, 
                        Am 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
                C  F        C 
'neath the halo of a street lamp, 
                          F         C 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp, 
        F                        (Dm7)           C                         Am C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, that split the night,  
                G        Am 
And touched the sound of silence. 
 
                         G 
And in the naked light I saw 
                           Am 
Ten thousand people, maybe more. 
               C   F        C 
People talking without speaking, 
                   F         C 
People hearing without listening, 
               F          (Dm7)        C                    Am C 
People writing songs that voices never share, and no one dare  
            G        Am 
Disturb the sound of silence. 
 
                              G 
"Fools!", said I, "You do not know,"
                       Am 
"Silence like a cancer grows."
                   C F            C 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
                    F            C 
Take my arms that I might reach you. 
       F          (Dm7)            C     C  Am    C
But my words like silent raindrops fell,      and echoed
       G        Am 
in the wells of silence.
 
                         G 
And the people bowed and prayed 
                     Am 
To the neon God they made. 
        (C)              F         C 
And the sign flashed out it's warning, 
                     F        C 
In the words that it was forming. 
                        F 
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets 
    (Dm7)                 C                        Am      C      
Are written on the subway walls, and tenement halls,"  and whisper'd
       G         Am 
in the sounds of silence.
