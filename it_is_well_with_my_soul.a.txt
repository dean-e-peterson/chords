It Is Well With My Soul (in A)
 - Lyrics by H. G. Spafford, music by Phillip P. Bliss, tenor range B2-B3 in A

Intro: A  (A7)  D  C#m  Bm  E  A  (or A D A E A)

     A              E   A Bm E       A
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
C#m  F#m          B           E
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
E7  A       D         (F#7) B            E
Whatever my lot, Thou hast  taught me to say,
E7    A     A/C# D  A/E   E       A
It is well, it   is well, with my soul.

       A               E    A      Bm E          A
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
C#m  F#m          B          E
Let  this blest assurance control,
E7   A            D     (F#7) B          E
That Christ has regarded my   helpless estate,
E7       A    A/C# D   A/E   E      A
And hath shed His  own blood for my soul.

Refrain:
      E      Esus4 E               A      E       A
It is well, (it is well,)  with my soul, (with my soul,)
      D           A     E       A          (or A A7 D C#m Bm E A)
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

   A                  E  A    Bm  E    A
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
C#m F#m         B            E
My  sin, not in part but the whole,
E7 A             D      (F#7) B          E
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
E7         A     A/C#   D   A/E   E    A
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

    A                 E  A  Bm     E        A
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
C#m F#m     B             E
If  Jordan above me shall roll,
E7 A             D     (F#7)  B           E
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
E7        A   A/C# D   A/E   E     A
Thou wilt whisper  Thy peace to my soul.

Refrain

     A                    E   A   Bm E      A
But, Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
C#m  F#m          B             E
The  sky, not the grave, is our goal;
E7  A            D     (F#7) B            E
Oh, trump of the angel!  Oh, voice of the Lord!
E7      A     A/C# D  A/E  E     A
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

    A                   E    A  Bm    E        A
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
C#m  F#m              B         E
The  clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
E7  A             D      (F#7)   B            E
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
E7   A   A/C# D  A/E  E       A
Even so, it   is well with my soul.
