Intro :  E

E
You keep saying, you've got something for me,
E                                   (E7)
Something you call love, but confess,
A(7)
You've been messing where you shouldn't be messing,
        E
And now someone else is getting all your best.


CHORUS:
      G                  E
These boots are made for walking,
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E     (n.c.)                  (E)
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.


E
You keep lying when you ought to be truthing,
E                                            (E7)
And you keep losing when you ought to not bet,
A7
You keep sameing when you ought to be -a- changing,
    E7
Now what's rights right but you aint been right yet.


(Chorus)


E
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing,
E                                                    (E7)
and you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned.  Ha!
A7
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah,
E
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn.


(Chorus)


E
Are you ready boots, start walking...

(Instrumental)
