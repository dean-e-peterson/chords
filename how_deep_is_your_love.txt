A11         D           F#m7     Em7
I know your eyes in the morning sun,
B7          Em7             F#7      A11
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain,
         D              F#m7    Bm7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Em7                   A11  (A)
I wanna feel you in my arms again.

         Gmaj7           F#m7
And you come to me on a summer breeze,
        Em7                          C9
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave.
         F#m7            A11                    D
And it's me you need to show, how deep is your love?
                                           (How deep...
CHORUS:
    D                        Dmaj7              Gmaj7             Gm6
How deep is your love?  How deep is your love?  I really mean to learn,
             D                    Am                 B7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breakin' us down,
                             Em7
When they all should let us be.
      Gm6            D         (Instrumental:   F#m7  Em7  B7  Em7  F#7  A11)
We belong to you and me.


D   F#m7      Em7  B7            Em7        F#7   A11 
I believe in you.  You know the door to my very soul. 
            D          F#m7      Bm7
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour,
          Em7              A11  (A)
You're my saviour when I fall.

         Gmaj7           F#m7
And you may not think I care for you,
         Em7                      C9
When you know down inside that I really do.
         F#m7            A11                    D
And it's me you need to show, how deep is your love?
                                           (How deep...
CHORUS:
How deep is your love?  How deep is your love?  I really mean to learn,
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breakin' us down,
When they all should let us be.
We belong to you and me.

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave.
And it's me you need to show, how deep is your love?

How deep is your love?  How deep is your love?  I really mean to learn,
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breakin' us down,
When they all should let us be.
We belong to you and me.
