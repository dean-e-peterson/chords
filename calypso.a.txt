   A
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,
                          (Amaj7)     D6
to ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
   A
To work in the service of life and living,
                                        D6
In search of the answers of questions unknown
      A
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,
                          Em(7)
Part of beginning to understand,


(Chorus)
D               A
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    D                  A
The things that you've shown us,
    E           A
The stories you tell,
D              A
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    D            A             E           A
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       E     D   A
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...

         A
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you,
                             (Amaj7)     D6
To light up the darkness and show us the way,
    A
For though we are strangers in your silent world,
                                           D6
To live on the land we must learn from the sea,
      A
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell,
                                Em(7)
Joyful and loving in letting it be,


(Chorus)
D               A
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    D                  A
The things that you've shown us,
    E           A
The stories you tell,
D              A
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    D            A             E           A
The men who have served you so long and so well,
       E     D   A
Hi dee ay-ee ooo...
E  D  A
