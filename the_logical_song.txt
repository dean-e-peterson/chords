Bm                               Gmaj7       F#m7
When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
  A                  Em7/G      E7/G#
a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.
            Bm                                 Gmaj7      F#m7
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,
A         Em7/G     G#m7b5 (or E7/G#?)
joyfully, playfully watching me.

              Bm                       Gmaj7     F#m7
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,
A        Em7/G        E7/G#
logical, responsible, practical.
         Bm                              Gmaj7   F#m7
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
A              Em7/G    G#m7b5 (or E7/G#?)
clinical, intellectual, cynical.

          D                           G#m7b5/D (or Bm)
There are times when all the world's asleep,
                      Gmaj7
the questions run too deep
                  C Cmaj7/B Am7 Am7/G
for such a simple man.

          D                                 G#m7b5/D (or Bm)
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
                 Gmaj7
I know it sounds absurd
                         C Cmaj7/B Am7 Am7/G
but please tell me who I am.


Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
liberal, fanatical, criminal.
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're
acceptable, respecable, presentable, a vegtable!


At night, when all the world's asleep,
the questions run so deep
for such a simple man.
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
                       (C Cmaj7/B Am7 Am7/G) x 3
but please tell me who I am.
