G                          Em
When this old world starts getting me down
    C                   D              G   (Em)
And people are just too much for me to face,
  G                   Em
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
    C                 D                G   (G7)
And all my cares just drift right into space.


C                (Cmaj7)         (C6)  (C)
On the roof it's peaceful as can be,
    G                 Em               C  D
And there the world below don't bother me.  Let me tell you now,


     G                   Em
When I come home feelin' tired and beat
     C               D                G    (Em)
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet.
     G                 Em
I'll get away from the hustling crowd
    C                 D                 G    (G7)
And all that rat-race noise down in the street.

C                 (Cmaj7)      (C6)  (C)
On the roof's the only place I know
      G                Em              C          D              G   (Em)
Where you just have to wish to make it so.  (Lets go)  Up on the roof.


C                      (Cmaj7)       (C6)  (C)
At night the stars put on a show for free,
    G               Em                C  D
And darling you can share it all with me.  I keep on telling you,


G                      Em
Right smack dab in the middle of town
     C           D                  G    (Em)
I've found a paradise that's troubleproof.
       G                     Em
And if this old world starts getting you down,
        C               D             G                Em
There's room enough for two up on the roof.  Up on the roof.
           G
Oh come on baby, oh come on darlin',
          Em (C G)         G
Up on the roof.  Up on the roof.  (repeat and fade)
