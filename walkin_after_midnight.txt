I go out walking after midnight
           F9                             C
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do,
                         Fm       G(7)          C   F C G
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you.


           C
I walk for miles along the highway
                 F9                      C
Well that's just my way of saying I love you
                         Fm       G(7)          C   F C C7
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you.


             F
I stopped to see a weeping willow,
                      C                       C7
Crying on his pillow, maybe he's crying for me.
    F
And as the skies turn gloomy.
                                 C                 G (G7 G6 G)
Night blooms whisper to me.  I'm lonesome as I can be.


         C
I go out walking after midnight
           F9                            C
Out in the moonlight just hoping you may be
                          Fm       G(7)          C   F C C7
Somewhere a-walking after midnight searching for me.

                                 C                 G  Ab (key change)
Night blooms whisper to me.  I'm lonesome as I can be.
