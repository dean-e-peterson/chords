Intro:  Dm7  G9  C11  F  (x3)


F         Dm7    G9          C11   F
Isn't she lovely?  Isn't she wonderful?
          Dm7      G9              C11    F
Isn't she precious?  Less than one minute old.
        Bbmaj7                    A7b9       Dm7              G9   
I never thought through love we'd be, making one as lovely as she. 
              C11               F
But isn't she lovely; made from love?


F         Dm7    G9          C11     F
Isn't she pretty?  Truly the angel's best.
            Dm7   G9             C11    F
Boy, I'm so happy.  We have been Heaven blessed.
        Bbmaj7               A7b9             Dm7                G9   
I can't believe what God has done; through us He's given life to one.
              C11               F
But isn't she lovely; made from love?


F         Dm7    G9              C11     F
Isn't she lovely?  Life and love are the same.
          Dm7  G9           C11    F
Life is A-isha, the meaning of her name.
           Bbmaj7              A7b9          Dm7                   G9   
Londie, it could have not been done, without you who conceived the one,
               C11               F
That's so very lovely; made from love.
