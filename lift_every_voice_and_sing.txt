[Verse 1]
    A7         D     F#7/C# Bm
    Lift every voice and    sing,
                   D/A F#7 Bm
    'Til earth and hea-ven ring,
                  Em  F#7  G       D/A  A7
    Ring with the har-mo - nies of Liberty;
              D  F#7/C# B
    Let our rejoicing   rise
    B7          Em   F#7  G
    High as the list'ning skies,
    G#dim    D/A               A7      D
    let it resound loud as the rolling sea.


    D    A7 Bm                                            D      A7
    Sing a  song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
    D    F Bb                                         D F#dim A7
    Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
               D  F#7/C#  B   B7         Em  F#7  G
    Facing the ri-sing    sun of our new day be - gun,
    G#dim7       D/A          A7    D
    Let us march on 'til victory is won.


[Verse 2]
    A7        D    F#7/C# Bm
    Stony the road we     trod,
               D/A   F#7  Bm
    Bitter the chastening rod,
                Em   F#7  G      D/A      A7
    Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
               D   F#7/C# B
    Yet with a steady     beat,
    B7           Em F#7 G
    Have not our weary  feet
    G#dim7      D/A                 A7                D
    Come to the place for which our parents [fathers] sighed?


    D  A7   Bm                                       D A7
    We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
    D  F    Bb                                               D F#dim  A7
    We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaugh - tered,
                 D   F#7/C# B
    Out from the gloomy     past,
    B7          Em    F#7 G
    'Til now we stand at  last
    G#dim7          D/A                 A7      D
    Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.


[Verse 3]
    A7         D  F#7/C# Bm
    God of our weary     years,
               D/A  F#7  Bm
    God of our si - lent tears,
                 Em      F#7 G        D/A    A7
    Thou who has brought us  thus far on the way;
                 D  F#7/C# B
    Thou who has by Thy might
    B7       Em F#7 G
    Led us into the light,
    G#dim7     D/A         A7       D
    Keep us forever in the path, we pray.


    D    A7  Bm                                                D A7
    Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
    D    F   Bb                                             D F#dim A7
    Lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget     Thee;
               D     F#7/C# B
    Shadowed beneath Thy    hand,
    B7         Em F#7 G
    May we for-ev-er  stand,
    G#dim7      D/A
    True to our God,
                A7     D
    True to our native land.
