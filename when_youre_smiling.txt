Intro found at www.jbott.com/whnsml.html, which I don't know the tune to:
    I saw a blind man, he was a kind man,
    Helping a fellow along,
    One could not see, one could not walk,
    But they both were humming this song:


(D   D7)    G                    Bm (or Gmaj7)
When you're smiling, when you're smiling,

    Em          E(7)        Am
The whole world smiles with you;

                                  Am7
When you're laughing, when you're laughing,

    D7        (D7+5)  G
The sun comes shining through.

                Dm7 (Dm7/A) G7    C
But when you're crying,       you bring on the rain,

   (Am7)     A7  (A7sus A7)   D      D7
So stop your sighing,      be happy again.

        G               Bm7         E7
Keep on smiling, 'cause when you're smiling

    Am(7b5)     D7          G
The whole world smiles with you.



Dean's satirical version about forcing people to smile when they shouldn't:

(D   D7)    G                      Bm (or Gmaj7)
When you're smiling, but feel like crying,
    Em          E(7)      Am
The world still smiles at you;
                                      Am7
When you're laughing, that lie you're crafting,
D7                (D7+5)   G
Saves us all from the real you.
                Dm7 (Dm7/A)  G7          C
But when you're honest,      you're just being a pain,
   (Am7)     A7   (A7sus A7)         D      D7
So stop your whining, pretend you're happy again.
         G               Bm7  E7
Life's depressing;  Keep on repressing.
          Am(7b5)  D7         G
And we'll all    repress with you.
