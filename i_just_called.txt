                                                                 DmMaj7 (xx0221)
                                                                 Dm7    (xx0211)
   Cmaj7      C       Cmaj7 C
No New Year's day, to cel-e-brate,
   Cmaj7     C       Cmaj7 C         Cmaj7 Dm  DmMaj7
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
            Dm   DmMaj7        Dm7  DmMaj7
No first of spring, no song to sing,
               Dm           G        C
In fact here's just another ordinary day.

   Cmaj7 C        Cmaj7   C
No April rain, no flowers bloom,
   Cmaj7   C    Cmaj7   C      Cmaj7    Dm  DmMaj7
No wedding Saturday within the month of June.
            Dm DmMaj7        Dm7  DmMaj7
But what it is, is something true,
           Dm                     G             C
Made up of these three words that I must say to you.


CHORUS:
       F         G     C       (C2  C  Cmaj7  C)
I just called to say I love you,
       F         G              Am   (Asus4  Am)
I just called to say how much I care.
       F         G     Am
I just called to say I love you,
      F                Gsus4  G     C
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.


   Cmaj7    C        Cmaj7  C
No summer's high, no warm July,
   Cmaj7   C       Cmaj7     C      Cmaj7  Dm  DmMaj7
No harvest moon to light one tender August night.
          Dm  DmMaj7         Dm7  DmMaj7
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
         Dm                G               C
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

   Cmaj7 C       Cmaj7 C
No Libra Sun, no Halloween,
   Cmaj7  C         Cmaj7   C         Cmaj7   Dm  DmMaj7
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
            Dm DmMaj7          Dm7  DmMaj7
But what it is, though old, so new.
             Dm                  G                C
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.


CHORUS: (Change key.)
       F#         Ab    C#
I just called, to say I love you.
       F#         Ab             Bbm
I just called, to say how much I care.
       F#         Ab    Bbm
I just called, to say I love you.
      F#               G#sus4 G     C#
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.


CHORUS: (Change key.)
       G          A     D
I just called, to say I love you.
       G          A              Bm
I just called, to say how much I care.
       G          A     Bm
I just called, to say I love you.
      G                A            D         C?    G               D
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart ... of my heart ... of my heart.
