A             Bm7                  C                D            G
I'm your only friend, I'm not your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend
    Am             Bb            E/B
But really I'm not actually your friend, but I am

[Chorus]
A                  D                           A/E         D/F#
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you
A      E      D                 C
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
               F/C                 C                F/C
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
C      Am     F         E       A    D    A    D
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

[Verse 1]
A        D             A         D
I have a secret to tell from my electrical well
A      E      A7              D               E
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
A                D             A          D
So the room must listen to me, filibuster vigilantly
A  E       A7          D                  E
My name is blue canary one note spelled l-i-t-e
F#m        D         B7                D               E
My story's infinite, like the longines symphonette, it doesn't rest

[Chorus]
A                  D                           A/E         D/F#
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you
A      E      D                 C
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
               F/C                 C                F/C
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
C      Am     F         E       A    D    A    D
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

F#m   D     B7     D
D#m   B     G#7    B
C#    C#/B  C#/A#  C#/G#   (third C# may be C#sus4 or F# instead?)

F#            G#m7                 A                B            E
I'm your only friend, I'm not your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend
    F#m            G             E
But really I'm not actually your friend, but I am

[Verse 2]
A                 D          A                D
There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry
A     E        A7               D                E
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck-free
A          D                A                D
Though I respect that a lot, I'd be fired if that were my job
A     E       A7            D                   E
After killing Jason off and countless screaming argonauts
F#m         D             B(7)          D           E
Bluebird of friendliness, like guardian angels it's always near

[Chorus 2]
A                  D                           A/E         D/F#
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you
A      E      D                 C
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
               F/C                 C                F/C
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
C      Am     F         E       A   A/C#
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

[Outro] (3x)
D                   A/E                 D/F# E/G#         A     E/G#    D/F#  D
While you're at it, keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
C              F/C                 C                F/C
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
C      Am     F         E       A
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
