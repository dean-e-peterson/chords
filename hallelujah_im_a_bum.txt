Oh, why don't you work like other men do?

How the hell can I work when there's no work to do?

Hallelujah, bum again,

Hallelujah, give us a handout, to revive us again!

Oh, I love my boss and my boss loves me,

Oh, the springtime has came and I'm just out of jail,
                       A
Without any money, without any bail.

Hallelujah, I'm a bum,

I went to a house, and I knocked on the door;
                            A
A lady came out, says, "You been here before."

Hallelujah, I'm a bum,

Hallelujah, give us a handout, to revive us again!

I went to a house, and I asked for a piece of bread;
                            A
A lady came out, says, "The baker is dead."

Hallelujah, I'm a bum,

D
When springtime does come, O won't we have fun,
                                  A
We'll throw up our jobs and we'll go on the bum.
   D
Hallelujah, I'm a bum,

Hallelujah, bum again,
   D                  G             A        D
Hallelujah, give us a handout, to revive us again!
