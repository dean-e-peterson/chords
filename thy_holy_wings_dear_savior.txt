Thy Holy Wings, Dear Savior
 - Swedish folk melody
 - lyrics by Lina Sandell
 - translated by Ernest Edwin Ryden

G        D           G     G7       C      D    G
Thy holy wings, dear Savior, spread gently over me;
             D          G      G7     C      D       G
And thru the long night watches, I'll rest secure in Thee.
               D           Em      A(7)   D  (D7)
Whatever may betide me, be Thou my hiding place,
    G      D        G    G7     C          D       G
And let me live and labor, each day, Lord, by Thy grace.


G           D       G       G7    C          D      G
Thy pardon, Savior, grant me, and cleanse me in thy blood;
          D       G     G7  C          D         G
Give me a willing spirit, a heart both clean and good.
                D           Em        A(7)      D  (D7)
O take into Thy keeping Thy children, great and small,
     G        D       G      G7  C        D       G   (Gsus4  G)
And, while we sweetly slumber, enfold us, one and all.
