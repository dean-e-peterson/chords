Intro?: C  Cadd5  F  G7  (repeat)

Cadd5                             Gdim
Next time you're found, with your chin on the ground,
        Dm7               G7  G6   G7add5/B C     (Dm7  G)
There a lot to be learned, so look a -      round.

C                    Dm7             F           G7        C6          C
Just what makes that little old ant, think he'll move that rubber tree plant?
C6     C     C7 F   Cdim  G      G7 G6  G7add5/B  C
Anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree      plant,

            F            (Cdim)  C
But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes,
         D7   Am7   D7   Am7   G    (G7)
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes.
       C                        C7                    F                  Cdim
So any time you're gettin' low, 'stead of lettin' go, just remember that ant.
C            A7   Dm      G(7)
Oops!  There goes another rubber tree ...
C            A7   Dm      G(7)
Oops!  There goes another rubber tree ...
C            A7   Dm      G(7)        C
Oops!  There goes another rubber tree plant.


Cadd5                        Gdim
When troubles call, and your back's to the wall,
        Dm7               G7    G6   G7add5/B C    (Dm7  G)
There a lot to be learned, that wall could    fall.

C                Dm7            F            G7      C6        C
Once there was a silly old ram, thought he'd punch a hole in a dam;
C6           C    C7   F   Cdim   G        G7 G6   G7add5/B  C
No one could make that ram scram.  He kept buttin' that      dam,

             F            (Cdim) C
'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes,
       D7   Am7   D7   Am7   G    (G7)
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes.
       C                        C7                     F                  Cdim
So any time you're feelin' bad, 'stead of feelin' sad, just remember that ram.
C            A7     Dm      G(7)
Oops!  There goes a billion kilowatt ...
C            A7     Dm      G(7)
Oops!  There goes a billion kilowatt ...
C            A7     Dm      G(7)     C
Oops!  There goes a billion kilowatt dam.


            F           (Cdim)   C
So he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes,
         D7   Am7   D7   Am7   G    (G7)
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes.
             C                   C7
All problems just a toy balloon; They'll be bursted soon,
F                        Cdim
They're just bound to go pop.
C            A7    Dm     G(7)
Oops!  There goes another problem ker -
C            A7    Dm     G(7)
Oops!  There goes another problem ker -
C            A7    Dm     G(7)          C     G     C
Oops!  There goes another problem ker - plop, ker - plop!
