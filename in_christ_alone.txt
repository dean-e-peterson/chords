In Christ Alone
 - Written by Keith Getty & Stuart Townend

   G       D       G       A
In Christ alone my hope is found,
D/F#     G        A           D
He is my light my strength my song.
     G     D           G     A
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
D/F#             G        A           D
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
     D/F#       G          D/F#      A
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
     D/F#      G            D/F#      A
When fears are stilled when strivings cease!
   G     D       G      A
My Comforter, my All in All,
D/F#        G       A        D
Here in the love of Christ I stand


   G       D           G       A
In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
D/F#        G      A        D
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
     G       D        G        A
This Gift of love and righteousness,
D/F#           G       A       D
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
     D/F#    G        D/F#  A
Till on that cross as Jesus died
    D/F#     G       D/F# A
The wrath of God was satisfied -
    G     D      G       A
For every sin on Him was laid:
D/F#        G        A        D
Here in the death of Christ I live.


      G       D         G    A
There in the ground His body lay,
D/F#         G        A        D
Light of the world by darkness slain.
     G        D        G        A
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
D/F#        G        A     D
Up from the grave He rose again!
    D/F#  G         D/F# A
And as He stands in victory,
      D/F#      G        D/F#    A
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
    G    D       G     A
For I am His and He is mine -
D/F#            G        A        D
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.


   G        D        G       A
No guilt in life, no fear in death;
D/F#        G        A         D
This is the power of Christ in me.
     G            D      G     A
From life's first cry to final breath,
D/F#     G        A    D
Jesus commands my destiny.
   D/F#     G        D/F#      A
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
    D/F# G        D/F#     A
Can ever pluck me from His hand,
     G    D        G        A
Till He returns or calls me home
D/F#        G        A           D
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!
