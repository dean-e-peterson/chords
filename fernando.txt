Can you hear the drums Fernando?
                                              F#m
I remember long ago another starry night like this.
                    Bm
In the firelight Fernando,
                                                          E
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar.
                                                                           A
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar.

A
They were closer now Fernando.
                                               F#m
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally.
                   Bm
I was so afraid Fernando.
                                                          E
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die.
                                                                       A
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry.

                           E7
There was something in the air that night,
                            A
The stars were bright, Fernando.
                            E7
They were shining there for you and me,
                  A
For liberty, Fernando.
          A7                           F#                  B7
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret.
                   E7
If I had to do the same again,
                         D    A
I would, my friend, Fernando.

A
Now we're old and grey Fernando.
                                                    F#m
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand.
                           Bm
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
                                                                      E
Do you still recall the fateful (frightful?) night we crossed the Rio Grande?
                                                                           A
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land.

                           E7
There was something in the air that night,
                            A
The stars were bright, Fernando.
                            E7
They were shining there for you and me,
                  A
For liberty, Fernando.
          A7                           F#                  B7
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret.
                   E7
If I had to do the same again,
                         D    A
I would, my friend, Fernando.
