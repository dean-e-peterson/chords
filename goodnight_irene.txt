CHORUS:
A          E       E7         A
Irene, goodnight.  Irene, goodnight.
    A       A7        D                 E7            A
Goodnight, Irene, goodnight Irene, I'll see you in my dreams.

  A                  E
I asked your mother for you,
    E7                  A
She told me you was too young.
  A             A7                  D
I wished to the Lord that I'd never seen your face,
    E7                 A
I's sorry you ever was born.

(Chorus)

Sometimes I live in the country,
Sometimes I live in town.
Sometimes I have a great notion
to jump in the river and drown.

(Chorus)

Quit ramblin' and quit gamblin'.
Quit stayin' out late at night.
Stay home with your wife and family.
Sit down by the fireside bright.

(Chorus)

I love Irene, God knows I do,
I'll love her till the seas run dry.
If Irene turns her back on me,
I'm gonna take morphine and die.

(Chorus)

You cause me to weep, you cause me to mourn
You cause me to leave my home
But the very last words I heard her say
Was "Please sing me one more song"

(Chorus)
