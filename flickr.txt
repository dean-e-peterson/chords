    There's a small town in the mountains where the streets are wide and still
              F                             C   Csus4 C
    There are children making angels in the snow
        F                 G
    The sunset paints the sky at night
       C       Em       Am
    An old man works by candlelight
      Dm       (Dm7)                G  Gsus2 G
    A tiny baby smiles and waves hello
           F        (Am)     (Dm)     G     C
    In the cold gray light of dawn an eagle flies
            Dm                             G   Gsus4 G
    And the men are happy wearing matching ties

BRIDGE 1:
              Bb     F
    A pair of poodles
             C
    A broken finger will not bend
              Bb     F
    Soup with noodles
             C
    A female Klingon's drunk boyfriend
           Bb  F
    A sexy lady
                 C
    This party's better than it seems

VERSE 2:
      C
    A visit to the dentist
      F                 G
    A place to get some pie
      F                           C   Csus4 C
    A rainbow floats above a waterfall
      F               G
    A ferris wheel, a carousel
        C        Em    Am
    The landlord never learned to spell
    Dm             (Dm7)        G   Gsus2 G
    Someone put graffiti on the wall
     F      (Am)      (Dm)     G       C
    Atop the Christmas tree, a shining star
        Dm                            G  Gsus4 G
    And Dwyer's rocking out on air guitar

    A freight train passes
              C
    Someone's grandma owns a gun
               Bb     F
    A dog with glasses
                 C
    A strange balloon man has too much fun
                  Bb      F
    Thumbs up for Slurpees
              C
    If you're receiving then you're not gay
              Bb
    A case of herpes

    As it turns out the eyepatch        is A-OK
