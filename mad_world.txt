[Verse 1]

Am                  C
All around me are familiar faces
G                D
Worn out places, worn out faces
Am                         C
Bright and early for their daily races
G              D
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Am                          C
And their tears are filling up their glasses
G              D
No expression, no expression
Am                      C
Hide my head; I want to drown my sorrow
G            D
No tomorrow, no tomorrow


[Chorus]

Am                       D
   And I find it kind of funny
                  Am
I find it kind of sad
                        D
The dreams in which I'm dying
                       Am
Are the best I've ever had
                  D
I find it hard to tell you,
                         Am
'cause I find it hard to take
                   D
When people run in circles it's a very, very...


Am C   D
   Mad world
Am C   D
   Mad world
Am C   D
   Mad world
Am C   D
   Mad world


[Verse 2]

Am                       C
Children waiting for the day they feel good
G               D
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Am                        C
Made to feel the way that every child should
G               D
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Am                       C
Went to school and I was very nervous
G               D
No one knew me, no one knew me
Am                     C
Hello, teacher tell me what's my lesson?
G                      D
Look right through me, look right through me


[Chorus]
