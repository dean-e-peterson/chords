A        D               D/A  A
Children of the heav'nly Fa - ther
       Em     A     Dsus2  D
Safely in His bosom ga  -  ther;
D7       G                   D
Nestling bird nor star in heaven
       Em     A7      (Dsus2)  D
Such a refuge e'er was giv  -  en.

A       D                 D/A  A
God His own doth tend and nour-ish;
       Em   A           Dsus2   D
In His holy courts they flour - ish;
D7       G                     D
From all evil things He spares them;
       Em     A7     (Dsus2) D
In His mighty arms He bears  them.

A       D                    D/A  A
Neither life nor death shall ev - er
         Em       A        Dsus2 D
From the Lord His children sev - er;
D7   G                     D
Unto them His grace He showeth,
          Em      A7    (Dsus2) D
And their sorrows all He know - eth.

A         D            D/A   A
Though He giveth or He tak - eth,
        Em       A         Dsus2 D
God His children ne'er for-sak - eth;
D7      G                  D
His the loving purpose solely
      Em         A7      (Dsus2) D
To preserve them pure and ho  -  ly.

A         D             D/A   A
Lo, their very hairs He num - bers,
       Em    A       Dsus2 D
And no daily care en-cum - bers
D7        G                    D
Them that share His ev'ry blessing
        Em      A7      (Dsus2)  D
And His help in woes dis-tress - ing.

A          D              D/A   A
Praise the Lord in joyful num - bers:
        Em     A     Dsus2  D
Your Protector never slum - bers.
D7     G                 D
At the will of your Defender
      Em     A7      (Dsus2)  D
Ev'ry foeman must sur-ren  -  der.
