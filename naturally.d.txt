Ever since you said goodbye to me,
        D                B7          E7              G   Gm
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom,
         D            B7        E7      A7             D
Cause we all want you back, you see.  Mmmm ... Naturally.

And though mister moon is left without a tune
        Bm (or D6)        Bm7  G   Gm
And his shadow's lost the harmony,
   D               B7         E7                   G

And now the bees have been gone, they know that something's wrong,
       Bm (or D6)           Bm7        G   Gm
'Cause they don't feel like buzzing at all.
        D               B7         E7             G   Gm
And the stars up in the sky, well, all they do is cry
    D              B7        E7  A7
And that's why the rain must fall,

        D             B7      G                     F#7sus4 F#7
