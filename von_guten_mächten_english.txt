[Verse 1]
   D             A/C#        Bm    Bm/A
By loving forces silently surrounded,
             G              F#m               Em  A (Asus2 A)
I feel quite soothed, secure, and filled with grace.
   D               A/C#              Bm    Bm/A
So I would like to live these days together,
    G             A          D Dsus4 D
and go with you into another year.


[Refrain]
   D             A/C#        Bm       Bm/A
By loving forces wonderfully sheltered,
        G          F#m             Em   A (Asus2 A)
we are awaiting fear - lessly what comes.
    D             A/C#            Bm     Bm/A
God is with us at dusk and in the morning
    G           A           D Dsus4 D
and most assuredly on ev'ry day.


[Verse 2]                                                  [Verse 3]
      D              A/C#              Bm        Bm/A          D                A/C#          Bm     Bm/A
Still matters of the past are pressing our hearts          And when you pass to us the bitter chalice,
    G             F#m              Em  A (Asus2 A)         G                     F#m             Em  A (Asus2 A)
and evil days are weighing down on us.                     filled with suffering to the brim and more,
   D            A/C#                 Bm  Bm/A                 D                A/C#                 Bm  Bm/A
Oh Lord, to our souls, so scared and sore,                 we take it, full of thanks and trembling not,
     G               A                D Dsus4 D                 G                 A           D Dsus4 D
give rescue, as it's that you made us for.                 from this, your caring and beloved hand.


                                                           [Verse 4]
                                                               D              A/C#                Bm   Bm/A
                                                           But if you want to please us, over and again,
                                                           G                F#m              Em   A (Asus2 A)
                                                           with our shining sun and wondrous world,
                                                                  D               A/C#              Bm   Bm/A
                                                           let us muse on what is past, and then we shall,
                                                           G                  A             D Dsus4 D
                                                           with our lives, in all belong to you.


[Refrain]
   D             A/C#        Bm       Bm/A
By loving forces wonderfully sheltered,
        G          F#m             Em   A (Asus2 A)
we are awaiting fear - lessly what comes.
    D             A/C#            Bm     Bm/A
God is with us at dusk and in the morning
    G           A           D Dsus4 D
and most assuredly on ev'ry day.


[Verse 5]                                                  [Verse 6]
D               A/C#            Bm         Bm/A                 D                A/C#           Bm        Bm/A
Warm and bright be our candles' flame today,               When silence now will snow around us ev'rywhere,
      G              F#m                Em   A (Asus2 A)      G               F#m           Em   A (Asus2 A)
since into gloom you brought a gleaming light,             so let us hear the all-embracing sound
    D              A/C#           Bm    Bm/A                  D                   A/C#           Bm   Bm/A
and lead again us, if you will, together!                  of greater things than we can see and wider,
   G                A              D Dsus4 D                    G                   A                  D Dsus4 D
We know it: you are beaming in the night.                  your world, and all your children's soaring hail.


[Refrain]
   D             A/C#        Bm       Bm/A
By loving forces wonderfully sheltered,
        G          F#m             Em   A (Asus2 A)
we are awaiting fear - lessly what comes.
    D             A/C#            Bm     Bm/A
God is with us at dusk and in the morning
    G           A           D Dsus4 D
and most assuredly on ev'ry day.
