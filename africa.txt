Intro:  F   Em Am  (x4)

G                Bm        Em
I hear the drums echoing tonight
G            F                Am          Em   F   Em  Am
She has only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
G                Bm            Em
She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight
    G                 F                    Am                 Em   F   Em  Am
The moonlight winds reflect the stars that guide me toward salva - tion
G            Bm                Em
I stopped an old man along the way
G                   F             Am               Em    F   Em  Am
Hoping to find some old forgotten words of ancient me-lo-dies
G            Bm7  (B7)   Em                   F                 (Em) Am
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy it's waiting there for you."

     Dm           Bb              F        C
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     Dm                     Bb             F               C
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
     Dm          Bb            F   C
     I bless the rains down in Africa
     Dm              Bb             F               Am  C Dm  (C)   F   Em  Am
     Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

G             Bm             Em
The wild dogs cry out in the night
   G                  F                Am       Em   F   Em  Am
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
G           Bm               Em
I know that I must do what's right
        G           F           Am               Em     F   Em  Am
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
G         Bm7         (B7)   Em                       F                 (Em) Am
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

     Dm           Bb              F        C
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     Dm                     Bb             F               C
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
     Dm          Bb            F   C
     I bless the rains down in Africa
     Dm              Bb             F               Am  C Dm  (C)   F   Em  Am
     Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
