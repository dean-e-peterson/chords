G7        C                  F
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry,
         G7                     C
I was confused, you cleared my mind,
             C7               F
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me,
            D7              G
And held me up, and gave me dignity,
            G7
Somehow you needed me.

(G7)        C                  F
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            G7               C
To face the world, out on my own again.
              C7       F      F#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   C                E7     Am  D7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    G7             C           E7
You needed me, you needed me.

    (E7)  Am                  C
    And I can't believe it's you,
                F            C
    I can't believe it's true.
      Dm7       G7            C     E7
    I needed you and you were there.
             Am                C                   F        C
    And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
                D7                                G7
    'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares.

(G7)        C                F
You held my hand when it was cold.
           G7               C
When I was lost you took me home
               C7           F
You gave me hope when I was at the end,
              D7             G
And turned my lies back into truth again,
         G7
You even called me "friend".

(G7)        C                  F
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            G7               C
To face the world, out on my own again.
              C7       F      F#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   C                E7     Am  D7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    G7             C        A7
You needed me, you needed me.
    D7      G7     C        A7  Dm7  G7sus4  G7  C
You needed me, you needed me.
