Intro:  D  Em  Em7  A7                             by Hal H. Hopson based on 1 Corinthians 13:

    A7       D  Em              D                  Intro:  G  Am/G  Am  D7
The water is wide, I cannot get o'er,
    F#m     Bm Em7 D/F#     Asus4  A                      D7    G Am7              G
And neither have I wings to fly.                   Though I may speak with bravest fire,
    (A/G) F#m G               F#m  Em                  (Gmaj7)  Em Am7  G     Dsus4  D
Give me a boat that will carry two,                And have the gift to all inspire,
    G          D  A    G          Em Em7 A7            (D7/C)   G  A               G  Am
And both shall row, my love and I.                 And have not love, my words are vain,
                                                               G   D      C           Am7 Am D7
      A7      D     Em            D                As sounding brass, and hopeless gain.
Where love is planted, O there it grows,
   F#m       Bm Em7   D/F#   Asus4  A                     D7    G Am7         G
It grows and blossoms like a rose.                 Though I may give all I possess,
   (A/G) F#m G              F#m  Em                    (Gmaj7)  Em Am7   G       Dsus4  D
It has a sweet and pleasant smell,                 And striving so    my love profess,
   G         D   A     G      Em Em7 A7                (D7/C) G   A             G  Am
No flower on Earth can it excel.                   But not be given by love within,
                                                              G  D       C            Am7 Am D7
  A7         D Em                  D               The profit soon turns strangely thin.
A ship there is  and she sails the sea,
      F#m    Bm Em7  D/F#     Asus4  A                   D7      G Am7               G
She's loaded deep as deep can be.                  Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control,
    (A/G)  F#m G                F#m  Em                (Gmaj7) Em Am7  G       Dsus4  D
But not so deep as the love I'm in,                Our spirits long to be made whole.
        G          D A  G          Em Em7 A7           (D7/C) G  A             G  Am
(And) I know (not) if I sink or swim.              Let inward love guide every deed;
                                                              G D      C           Am7 Am D7 G
  A7      D      Em            D                   By this we worship, and are freed.
O love is handsome and love is fine,
    F#m      Bm Em7      D/F#  Asus4  A
And love's a jewel while it is new.
    (A/G)      F#m G            F#m  Em
But when it is old  it grows so cold,
    G      D A      G         Em Em7 A7
And fades away like morning dew.


A couple of other verses:

     A7     D Em             D
Down in the meadow the other day,
  F#m     Bm Em7       D/F#       Asus4  A
Gathering flowers both bright and gay,
  (A/G)   F#m   G               F#m  Em
Gathering flowers, both red and blue,
  G      D     A      G         Em Em7 A7
I little thought what love can do.

  A7        D  Em                      D
I leaned my back up against some young oak,
    F#m     Bm Em7  D/F#  Asus4  A
Thinking he was   a trusty tree.
    (A/G)    F#m  G              F#m  Em
But first he bended, and then he broke,
    G        D A      G        Em Em7 A7
And thus did my false love to me.

  A7     D  Em               D
I put my hand into some soft bush,
    F#m      Bm Em7   D/F#      Asus4  A
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
  (A/G)      F#m G         F#m  Em
I pricked my finger to the bone,
    G        D A      G          Em Em7 A7
And left the sweetest flower alone.
