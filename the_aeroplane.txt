The Aeroplane
- by Tim Minchin

D            A                Bm  Bm/A
If I had the blueprint or the brain
G       D            A
I would build an aeroplane
    D                A              Bm  Bm/A
I'd fashion wings of balsa wood and glue
    G       A      D
And I would fly to you.

    Bm                G            D
I'd carve a prop from old recycled would haves
    A                Bm
All these relentless could haves
      G                    A
These pointless might have beens
        D                   A             Bm  Bm/A
Oh, the storms that I would gladly battle through
   G       A      D
So I could fly to you.


D          A             Bm  Bm/A
 Had I the method or the means
G       D          A
I would build a time machine
    D                A                 Bm  Bm/A
I'd make it from the scraps you always find
     G                    A               D
When someone leaves their broken dreams behind

        Bm               G                   D
And I'd fuel it with the beats that my heart misses
         A                   Bm
When you sign your name with kisses
        G            A
Made of x's when you text me, it's so silly but
D            A             Bm  Bm/A
Any fuel and any fire will do
G      A      D
I will fly to you.

        Bm                G            D
And I'd carve a prop from old recycled would haves
    A                Bm
All these relentless could haves
      G                    A
These pointless might have beens
        D              A             Bm  Bm/A
Oh, the storms I would gladly battle through
   G       A      D
So I could fly to you.
        D              A             Bm  Bm/A
Oh, the storms I would gladly battle through
   G       A      D
So I could fly to you.
