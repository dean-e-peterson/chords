Intro:  Gmaj7  C  Gmaj7  C

Gadd9             G                C     (Cadd9 C)
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
Gadd9         G                C   (Csus4 C)
To never have sunlight on your face.
Am          A2             Dsus4   D
You were content to let me shine, (that's your way)
Am         A2              D7sus4  D7
You always walked a step behind.

Gadd9        G                C    (Cmaj7 C)
So I was the one with all the glory,
Gadd9              G                C     (Csus4 C)
While you were the one with all the strain.
Am          A2             Dsus4  D
A beautiful face without a name, (for so long)
Am          A2                Dsus4  D  B7  Em
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.


Em           C                   G    D/F#  Em
Did you ever know that you're my hero,
Em             C               G    D/F#  Em
And everything I would like to be?
Em        C              G D/F# Em
I can fly higher than an eagle,
Am(7)           Am7/D  D7       G(add9) (G  Cadd9 C  Gadd9 G  Cadd9)
For you are the wind beneath my wings.


G               Gadd9      G   C      (Cmaj7 C)
It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
Gadd9           G              C    (Csus4 C)
But I've got it all here in my heart.
Am            A2              Dsus4   D
I want you to know I know the truth, (of course I know it)
Am         A2              Dsus4  D  B7  Em
I would be nothing without you.


Em           C                   G    D/F#  Em
Did you ever know that you're my hero,
Em             C               G    D/F#  Em
And everything I would like to be?
Em        C              G D/F# Em
I can fly higher than an eagle,
Am(7)           Am7/D  D7       G      B7
With you as the wind beneath my wings.

Em         C                  G    D/F#  Em
Did I ever tell you you're my hero,
Em                C               G    D/F#  Em
You're everything I would like to be?
Em        C              G D/F# Em
I can fly higher than an eagle,
Am(7)           Am7/D  D7       G    (Cadd9 Gadd9 G C G)
For you are the wind beneath my wings.
