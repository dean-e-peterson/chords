Parson Brown's Sheep
 - traditional English or Scottish?  Some version printed by William Pratt?
 - this version was sung by Swedish immigrant Marguerite (Anderson) Peterson.

G                D
Father stole the parson's sheep,
D7                  G
Now we'll have both bread and meat,
                    C
Now we'll have both bread and meat
G       D         G
for our Christmas dinner.

(spoken)
The parson heard me singing it, and said, 
"Little girl, will you sing that again?"
So I sang:

Father stole the parson's sheep,
Now we'll have both bread and meat,
Now we'll have both bread and meat
for our Christmas dinner.

(spoken)
The parson asked me, "Will you sing that in church this Sunday?"
I said, "But I have nothing to wear."
The parson said, "Don't worry about that. I will buy you a gown to wear."
And I said, "But I have nothing to put in the offering plate."
But he said, "I will give you half a crown."

(spoken)
That Sunday, the parson stood in front of the congregation, and said,
"Every word of what this little girl is going to sing is absolutely true."
Then I sang:

As I walked down the road one day,
I saw the farmers making hay,
I saw the parson in his shay,
and how he kissed Miss Molly.

(spoken)
And the parson cried, "False! False!"
But I didn't care. I just ran out singing:

Now I've cheated Parson Brown
Out of gown and half a crown,
Telling all the village folk
That he kissed Miss Molly.
