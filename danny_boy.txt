But if ye come, when all the flowers are dying, (and all the roses dying)

    Am   E        C#m(7)          F#m  B7
And I am dead, as dead I well may be,

     (A    B)  E                         A    (F#m)
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,

    (Am)      E      F#m Bsus2 B   E
And kneel and say an Ave there for me;

    A B     C#m (or E)   A               E (or G#m A)
And I shall hear, though soft your tread above me,

    A (G#m) C#m        A                Bsus4 B
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be.
(And then my grave will richer, sweeter be)

     B7        E       A       (A#dim)  E     C#m A
If you will not fail to tell me that you love me,
(For you will bend and tell me that you love me)

     (A#dim) E        G#m     A       B7      E
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!
(And I shall rest in peace until you come to me)

     (A#dim) E        G#m     A       B7      E
 (Oh Danny boy I love) you so

Londonderry Air (words from Hal Leonard's ultimate fake book)

Would God I were the tender apple blossom,
That floats and falls from off the twisted bough,
To lie and faint within your silken bosom,
Within your bosom as that does now.
Or would I were a little burnished apple
For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold,
While sun and shade your robe of lawn will dapple,
your robe of lawn and your hair's spun gold.
