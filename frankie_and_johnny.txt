Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
     C           G+       C   C7
And, oh, what a couple in love
F
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
                    F#dim  C
Just as true as the stars above
   A7      D7 G7                     C     (F#dim  G7  C  (G+))
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Now, Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
And the soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Now, Frankie's dad was a policeman
So she stole his old forty-four gun
And then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run
After the man who was doin' her wrong

And Frankie peeked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
Nellie and Johnny were makin' love
And sippin' soda through a straw
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
And she whipped out that long forty-four
And a rooty-toot-toot that gal did shoot
Through that harwood swingin' door
She shot her man 'cause he was doin' her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
And bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are a-comin' back
She shot her man 'cause he was doin' her wrong

C               G+       C
So this is the end of my story
    C            G+       C
And this is the end of my song
F
Frankie is down in the jailhouse
                  F#dim       C
And she cries the whole night long
   A7      D7 Fm6 G7               C
He was my man,      but he done me wrong
