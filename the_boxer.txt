The Boxer
 - by Paul Simon (actually in key of B?)

C                                       Em/B   Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told.
       G
I have squandered my resistance,
      G7                            C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises.
    Em/B     Am            G                 F
All lies and jest; still a man hears what he wants to hear,
                   C    G     G7 G6 C
And disregards the rest.

       C                                         Em/B   Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy,
       G
In the company of strangers,
       G7                         C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared.
Em/B   Am           G              F                                C
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go.
        G              F    Em   Dm    C
Looking for the places only they would know.

           Am           Em
    Lie-la-lie,  Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie,
           Am           G            (F)       (G)   C
    Lie la lie,  Lie-la-lie la la la lie la la la la lie.

C                                          Em/B  Am
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job,
             G
But I get no offers,
       G7                                 C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.
  Em/B Am                G                F                               C
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there.
       G               C
Ooo-la-la la la la la.

           Am           Em
    Lie-la-lie,  Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie,
           Am           G            (F)       (G)   C
    Lie la lie,  Lie-la-lie la la la lie la la la la lie.

         C                                 C       Em/B  Am           G
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes, and wishing I was gone.  Going home,
          G7                    G      C           Em          Am        G    C
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me.   Leading me,  Going Home.

       C                                     Em/B   Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade,
       G
And he carries the reminders,
   G7                                C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out,
             Em/B    Am
In his anger and his shame,
      G             F                                  C
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  but the fighter still remains.

           Am           Em
    Lie-la-lie,  Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie,
           Am           G            (F)       (G)   Am
    Lie la lie,  Lie-la-lie la la la lie la la la la lie.

    (Repeat chorus; fade, or end last repeat on C and play first verse chords?)
