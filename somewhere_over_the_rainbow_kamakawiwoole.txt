C         Em               F      C
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
F       C                        G              Am     F
And the dreams that you dream of once in a lullaby 		
C         Em               F          C
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly  	
F       C                         G                     Am     F
And the dreams that you dream of, dreams really do come true	 	
    C                          G                                  Am   F
Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G                              Am           F
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me	
C         Em               F         C
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly		
F       C                           G                 Am     F
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?			
            C       Em        F            C
Well I see trees of green and red roses too, 	
F               C         E7     Am
I'll watch then bloom for me and you
      F                G                Am     F
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world		
           C        Em             F         C             F             C
Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white and the brightness of day 	
E7         Am          F               G                C        F    C
I like the dark and I think to myself, what a wonderful world
    G                        C
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    G                    C
are also on the faces of people passing by
      F               C              F          C
I see friends shaking hands saying, "How do you do?"
F              C       Dm           G
They're really saying, I,    I love you
       C      Em        F          C
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
F                  C     E7        Am
They'll learn much more than we'll know
      F                G                Am     F
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
C                              G                                  Am    F
Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me
       C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G                              Am           F
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me	
C         Em               F      C
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
F       C                           G                 Am     F
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

C C Em Em F F C C
