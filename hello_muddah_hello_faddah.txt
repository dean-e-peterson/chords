            G             D
Hello Muddah, hello Fadduh,
            D7           G
Here I am at Camp Granada.
            F#           Bm
Camp is very entertaining,
         Asus2               A(7)             D
And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.

             G               D
I went hiking with Joe Spivey.
            D7         G
He developed poison ivy.
            B7              Cmaj7
You remember Leonard Skinner.
       G                  D                G
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.

                  G                D
All the counselors hate the waiters,
                D7         G
And the lake has alligators.
                  F#               Bm
And the head coach wants no sissies,
      Asus2            A(7)              D             (Return version from the Tonight Show)
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses.
                                                        Hello Muddah, hello Faddah,
                G                    D                  I am back at Camp Grenada.
Now I don't want this should scare ya,                  And I'm writing you this letter,
                D7          G                           Just to say my compound fracture's
But my bunk mate has malaria.                           getting better.
            B7            Cmaj7
You remember Jeffrey Hardy.                             No one here knows where my trunk is,
         G           D                G                 And my bunk is where the skunk is,
They're about to organize a searching party.            And this year the food's improving,
                                                        'Cause the little black things in it
Gm      Cm                                              are not moving.
Take me home, oh Muddah, Fadduh,
Gm      Cm                                              Our camp nurse is quite a swimmer,
Take me home, I hate Granada,                           She says swimming makes you slimmer.
Gm          Dm                    Cm                    Her name's Mrs. Pellagrini.
Don't leave me out in the forest, where                 Have you ever seen a whale in a bikini?
            Dm         D7
I might get eaten by a bear.                            All our bathrooms have such thin doors,
                                                        Gee, I'd wish they'd move them indoors.
Gm      Cm                     Gm       Cm              We're all tired of mother goose here,
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise,          So next Friday night they're having
                       Gm    Dm                         Lenny Bruce here.
Or mess the house with other boys.
                        Cm                              Let me stay, oh Muddah, Faddah,
Oh please don't make me stay,                           Let me stay, I love Grenada.
               Dm        D7                             Every night the campfire's really keen,
I've been here one whole day.                           Oh Ma, please send some unguintine.

              G               D                         Let me stay,
Dearest Fadduh, darling Muddah,                         up here in Muddah nature's land,
                 D7             G                       And tiptoe through the tulips grand,
How's my precious little Bruddah?                       To leave would be a shame.
                F#             Bm                       Besides, I'd miss the poker game.
Let me come home if you miss me.
        Asus2         A(7)           D                  Please don't worry, Faddah, Muddah,
I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me.           I'll take care of little brudda.
                                                        He plays ball here and he rows here,
             G                   D                      And I hope they teach him
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing.                      how to blow his nose here.
                 D7                G
Guys are swimming, guys are sailing.                    He wakes up half past six hand,
                B7                 Cmaj7                Goes directly to the quicksand.
Playing baseball, gee that's better.                    He was lonely, now he's better,
        G              D7             G                 He's like all of us
Muddah, Fadduh, kindly disregard this letter!           except his bed is wetter.
