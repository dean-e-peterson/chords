C    G    Am7    G   (x2)

C           G                  Am7     G
  I took my love and I took it down
C           G                       Am7     G
  Climbed a mountain then I turned around
      C        G               Am7          G
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G          Am7    G
Well the landslide brought me down

   C             G            Am7    G
Oh mirror in the sky, what is love?
        C               G          Am7   G
Can the child within my heart rise above
      C                G        Am7   G
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
      C          G       Am7   G
Can I handle the seasons of my life
   C     G     Am7    G
Uh ah................
   C             G                 Am7       D/F#
Uh ah.........Uh ah.........Uhhhhh ahhhhhh

[Chorus]
     G          D/F#     Em       Em
Well I've been afraid of changin' cause I
C       G          Am7    D7/F#
Built my life around you
    G              D/F#    Em           Em
But time makes you bolder, children get older
C           G     Am7  G
I'm getting older too, well ...

[Interlude]
C    G    Am7    G
C    G    Am7    G
C    G    Am7    G
C    G    Am7    D7

(Repeat Chorus)

   C         G                Am7   G
So take this love and take it down
                C       G                      Am7      G
Yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
           C        G               Am7          G
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G          Am7   G
Well the landslide brought me down

       C        G               Am7          G
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
C  G  Am7  G
Well maybe ...  (3x)
    C              G          Am7
The landslide will bring you down.
