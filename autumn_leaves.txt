Intro from azchords.com:  Am7  D  G  D/F#  Em  Bm/D  C7 B7 Em  A/E  Em-add9


(Em)        Am7  D7            Gmaj7  Cmaj7
The falling leaves drift by my window,

            F#m7b5 B7          Em  (Em9  Em)
            Am     B7          Em  (Em7)
The falling leaves  of red and gold.

           Am7 D7           Gmaj7  Cmaj7
I see your lips, the summer kisses,

              F#m7b5 B7 Cdim    Em Em6 Em7 Em6 Em
              Am     B7         Em
The sunburned hands   I used to hold.



          F#m7b5   B7             Em  Em7
          B7                      Em
Since you went away the days grow long,

              Am7 D7            Gmaj7  Cmaj7
And soon I'll hear old winter's song.

      F#m7b5           B7b9    Em    (Em-maj7 Em7 Em6)
      Am               B7      Em
But I miss you most of all, my darling,

Am/C        B7b9   B7       Em    A/E  Em-add9  (or E major...oh yeah)
Am          B7              Em(6)
When autumn leaves start to fall.

(Repeat from "Since you went away")
