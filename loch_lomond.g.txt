    G           Em            C           D
The wee birdies sing, and the wildflowers spring
       G            Em         C   D
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping
        C               Em       Am             C
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring again
D        G          Em               Am   D  G
Tho' the waeful may cease frae their grie -  ving

Oh! Ye'll tak' the high road, and I'll tak' the low road
    G          Em        C    D
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
    C         Em             Am          C
But me and my true love will never meet again
D      G              Em            Am  D  G
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lo  -  mond
