One of these nights at about twelve o'clock, this whole earth's gonna reel and rock...
Bb                      (Eb)     Bb                                   F           Bb

(Intro)  F#m  D   A   E  (x2)

   F#m       D    A              E
If God had a name, what would it be?
              F#m            D   A            E
And would you call it to His face if you were faced with Him
   F#m     D      A               E
In all his glory?  What would you ask
           F#m      D         A   E
If you had just one question?

D               E     (F#m)    D           E     (F#m)   D           E
And Yeah, yeah, God is great.  Yeah, yeah, God is good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

        F#m     D           A  E
What if God was one of us?
       F#m       D          A  E
Just a slob like one of us?
       F#m      D       A
Just a stranger on the bus
          E            F#m  D  A  E
Trying to make his way home...

   F#m       D    A              E
If God had a face, what would it look like?
    F#m               D   A          E
And would you want to see, if seeing meant that you
      F#m       D    A               E
Would have to believe in things like heaven
       F#m           D          A       E
And in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

D               E     (F#m)    D           E     (F#m)   D           E
And Yeah, yeah, God is great.  Yeah, yeah, God is good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

        F#m     D           A  E  (chords repeat  F#m  D  A  E)
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home
Trying to make his way home
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
              E               F#m  D  A  E
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome.

D               E     (F#m)    D           E     (F#m)   D           E
And Yeah, yeah, God is great.  Yeah, yeah, God is good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

        F#m     D           A  E  (chords repeat  F#m  D  A  E)
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way back home
Like a holy rolling stone
           E           F#m  D  A
Back up to heaven all alone
               E            D...   (remaining chords D and Dsus2 or D with riffs?)
Just trying to make his way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome...
