Intro:  Bm  G

            D            G                             Bm
She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette.
    A         D          G                                 A
She broke his heart.  He spent his whole life trying to forget.
   Bm                          A/C#  D
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time,
       Bm                     A        D                               A
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, until the night...

            D                      G          A
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger,
    Bm                     A   G
And finally drank away her memory.
D                                  A
Life is short but this time it was bigger
         Bm                        A       G
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees.
     D                                   A
They found him with his face down in the pillow,
       Bm                             A     G
With a note that said, I'll love her 'til I die.
    D                              A
And when we buried him beneath the willow
    G                          Bm
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.
Bm                                       G
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la
Bm                                       G
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la


           D           G                                Bm
The rumors flew, but nobody knew how much she blamed herself.
    A         D         G                                A
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath.
    Bm                      A/C#  D
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time,
        Bm                     A        D                               A
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind, until the night...

             D                      G          A
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger,
    Bm                     A   G
And finally drank away his memory.
D                                  A
Life is short but this time it was bigger
         Bm                         A       G
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees.
   D                                   A
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Bm                      A        G
Clinging to his picture for dear life.
   D                                A
We laid her next to him beneath the willow,
      G                          Bm
While angels sang a whiskey lullaby.
Bm                                       G   Bm  G
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la
