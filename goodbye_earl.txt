 - by Dennis Linde, performed by the Dixie Chicks

C                            F               C                             G
Mary Anne And Wanda were the best of friends all through their high school days,
C                   F             C             G   C
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the F.F.A.
C                     F              C                        G    (G7)
After graduation Mary Anne went out, lookin' for a bright new world.
C                 F                    C       G         C
Wanda looked all around this town, and all she found was Earl.

        C                    F                    C                      G
Well it wasn't 2 weeks after she got married that Wanda started gettin' abused.
        C                   F                         C          G       C
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses, and make-up to cover a bruise.
         C                        F
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce;
    C                        G    (G7)
She let the law take it from there.
         C                           F
But Earl walked right through that restraining order,
    C            G       C
And put her in intensive care.

       Am                 G                     F                C     Em/B
Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta, on a red eye midnight flight.
         Am                    G
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan,
       F                     G                     C
And it didn't take long to decide that Earl had to die.

 C               F   C            G   F                      C
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah nah...)  Goodbye Earl. Those black-eyed peas?
 C               F                    C            G  F                    C
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah...)  They tasted all right to me Earl. You're feeling weak?
 C               F                      C            G     F              C
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah...)  Why don't you lay down and sleep Earl? Ain't it dark?
 C               F                C          G     F        C  F  C(addG) F
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah...)  Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

    C            F                   C                           G
The cops came to bring Earl in; they searched the house high and low,
          C                           F
Then they tipped their hats and said "Thank you ladies,
       C             G      C
If you hear from him let us know."
         C                  F                            C                G (G7)
Well the weeks went by, and spring turned to summer, and summer faded into fall.
       C                  F                  C      G         C
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all.

       Am                            G                     F         C  Em/B
So the girls bought some land, and a roadside stand out on highway 109.
          Am                G
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam,
         F                       G                          C
And they don't lose any sleep at night.  'Cause Earl had to die.

 C               F   C            G   F                C
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah nah...)  Goodbye Earl.  We need a break.
(n.c.)           F               C          G     F                   C
                        Let's go out to the lake, Earl.  We'll pack a lunch.
 C               F                C          G     F                      C
(Nah nah-nah-nah nah...)And stuff you in the trunk Earl. Well is that all right?
 C                      F            C        G     F        C F C(addG) F C F C
(Nah nah-nah-nah...)    Good!  Let's go for a ride, Earl.  Hey!
