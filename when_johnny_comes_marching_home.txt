     Em
When Johnny comes marching home again,
   G
Hurrah! Hurrah!
      Em
We'll give him a hearty welcome then,
   G       (B7)
Hurrah! Hurrah!
    Em                     D
The men will cheer and the boys will shout,
    C                B
The ladies they will all turn out,
          Em  B7   Em  Am6  Em           B7sus4   Em
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. (2x)

    Em
The old church bell will peal with joy,
   G
Hurrah! Hurrah!
   Em
To welcome home our darling boy,
   G       (B7)
Hurrah! Hurrah!
    Em               D
The village lads and lassies say,
     C               B
With roses they will strew the way,
          Em  B7   Em  Am6  Em           B7sus4   Em
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. (2x)

    Em
Get ready for the Jubilee,
   G
Hurrah! Hurrah!
      Em
We'll give the hero three times three,
   G       (B7)
Hurrah! Hurrah!
    Em               D
The laurel wreath is ready now,
   C              B
To place upon his loyal brow,
          Em  B7   Em  Am6  Em           B7sus4   Em
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. (2x)

    Em
Let love and friendship on that day,
   G
Hurrah! Hurrah!
      Em
Their choicest treasures then display,
   G       (B7)
Hurrah! Hurrah!
    Em              D
And let each one perform some part,
   C                 B
To fill with joy the warrior's heart,
          Em  B7   Em  Am6  Em           B7sus4   Em
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. (2x)
