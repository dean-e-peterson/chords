Dm         Gm         Ddim           A
Early each day to the steps of Saint Paul's
    Dm         A          Dm
The little old bird woman comes.
       Dm          Gm         Ddim       A
In her own special way to the people she calls,
Dm            A            Dm
"Come, buy my bags full of crumbs.


C(7)                        F
Come feed the little birds, show them you care
C            (C7)         F   A7
And you'll be glad if you do.
      Dm             Gm            Ddim         A
Their young ones are hungry, their nests are so bare;
       Dm       A             Dm    C
All it takes is tuppence from you."


F        Am     Bb         F
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,
Bb        F         G7         C  (Cadd-9  C)
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag.
F         Am      Bb              F
"Feed the birds," that's what she cries,
Bb        F         C              F
While overhead, her birds fill the skies.


A    Dm          A           Dm          A
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles
     Dm          A         Dm
Look down as she sells her wares.
  F                C           F             C
Although you can't see it, you know they are smiling
     F  (or Dm)   A7            Dm   C
Each time someone shows that he cares.


F          Am        Bb         F
Though her words are simple and few,
Bb      F             G7         C(7)
Listen, listen, she's calling to you:
F         Am     Bb         A
"Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,
Bb        G9        Gm9      C  F
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a  bag."
