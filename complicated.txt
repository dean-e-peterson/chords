Complicated
 - by Avril Lavigne & The Matrix (Scott Spock, Lauren Christy, & Graham Edwards)
 - needs work, including checking chords (against acoustic on youtube?)

Intro:  Dm  Bb  F  C

VERSE 1:
F                               Dm
Chill out.  What you yellin for?  Lay back.  It's all been done before.
Bb                    C
And if you could only let it be, you will see.
F                         Dm
I like you the way you are, When we're drivin' in your car,
Bb                      C
And you're talkin to me one-on-one, but you become...


BRIDGE:
Bb (Dm?)
Somebody else, Round everyone else,
Dm
Watchin' your back, Like you can't relax.
       Bb                                         C
You're tryin' to be cool; You look like a fool to me.  Tell me...


CHORUS:
Dm                            Bb              F         C
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?  I see the way you're
Dm                          Bb               F        C
Actin' like you're somebody else gets me frustrated.  Life's like this you,
Dm                Bb
You fall, and you crawl,
                       F
And you break, And you take...
                      C
What you get, and you turn into...
Gm                       Bb                   F        Bb      F
Honesty.  Promise me I'm never gonna find you fakin'.  No, no, no.


VERSE 2:  (play like verse 1, F  Dm  Bb  C...)
You come over unannounced, dressed up like you're something else,
Where you are and Where it's at you see, You're makin' me...
Laugh out, when you strike a pose.  Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not foolin anyone, when you become...

BRIDGE:
Bb
Somebody else, Round everyone else,
Dm
Watchin' your back, Like you can't relax.
       Bb                                         C
You're tryin' to be cool; You look like a fool to me.  Tell me...


CHORUS:
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?  I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else gets me frustrated.  Life's like this you,
You fall, and you crawl,
And you break, And you take...
What you get, and you turn into...                    Bb                  C
Honesty.  Promise me I'm never gonna find you fakin'. No no (no no no) No no
