Why are there so many songs about rain - bows,
    A             F#m7  Dadd2  D/E  Esus4
And what's on the other side?
A            F#m          Bm7     (D/E)  E
Rainbows are visions, but only il - lu - sions,

The lovers, the dreamers and me.

Who said that every wish would be heard and an - swered
     A             F#m7    Dadd2  D/E  Esus4
When wished on the morning star?
A        F#m                  Bm7      (D/E)   E
Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it;
    A              F#m7    Dadd2  Dadd2/A
And look what it's done so far.
Dmaj7
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing,

All of us under its spell,

We know that it's probably mag - ic.

Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sail - ors?

The voice might be one and the same.
