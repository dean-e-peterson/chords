  Am                       C9
I dreamed last night I got on the boat to heaven
    Am                   C9               C7+5
And by some chance I had brought my dice along
    Em      F7          Em                Eb9
And there I stood and I hollered "Someone fade me"
        Am               E               Gm  (C) G7
But the passengers, they knew right from wrong.

        C          C7       F Fm      C            D7          Ab9 G7
For the people all said sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat
C          C7       F Fm      C           G7          C
People all said sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat.
        F9                                                              G7
And the devil will drag you under, by the sharp lapel of your checkered coat,
     C         C7        F         Fm        C          G7          C   E7+5
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat.

  Am                  C9
I sailed away on that little boat to heaven
    Am                     C9           C7+5
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist
    Em      F7            Em              Eb9
And there I stood, nicely passin' out the whisky
        Am              E          Gm  (C) G7
But the passengers were bound to resist.

        C          C7     F Fm         C    D7       Ab9 G7
For the people all said beware, you're on a heavenly trip
C          C7     F Fm    C            G7          C
People all said beware, Beware, you'll scuttle the ship.
        F9                                                             G7
And the devil will drag you under, By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
     C         C7        F         Fm        C           G7          C   E7+5
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat.

    Am                    C9
And as I laughed at those passengers to heaven
  Am                      C9            C7+5
A great big wave came and washed me overboard!
    Em   F7         Em                Eb9
And as I sank And I hollered "someone save me!"
           Am            E             Gm  (C) G7
That's the moment I woke up, thank the Lord

      C         C7        F Fm      C            D7          Ab9 G7
And I said to myself, sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat!
C         C7       F Fm      C           G7          C
Said to myself sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat.
        F9                                                         G7
And the devil will drag you under With a soul so heavy you'd never float,
     C         C7        F         Fm        C          G7          C
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat.
     C         C7        F         Fm        C          G7          C
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat.
