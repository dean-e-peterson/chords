D       (Dsus2) G       A
Brother, let me be your servant,
D      Bm    Em        A
Let me be as Christ to you;
G         D     G        A
Pray that I may have the grace
   G       Em    G A      D
To let you be my servant, too.

D     (Dsus2)   G    A
We are pilgrims on a journey,
D      Bm       Em     A
We are brothers on the road;
G      D       G         A
We are here to help each other
G        Em       G  A     D
Walk the mile and bear the load.

D     (Dsus2)   G           A
I will hold the Christlight for you
D      Bm         Em      A
In the night-time of your fear;
G      D       G        A
I will hold my hand out to you,
G         Em        G  A    D
Speak the peace you long to hear.

D     (Dsus2)    G       A
I will weep when you are weeping,
D        Bm         Em         A
When you laugh I'll laugh with you;
G      D          G       A
I will share your joy and sorrow
G          Em        G  A    D
Till we've seen this journey through.

D      (Dsus2)  G      A
When we sing to God in heaven
D        Bm        Em   A
We shall find such harmony,
G       D         G       A
Born of all we've known together
G           Em       G A   D
Of Christ's love and a - gony.

D      (Dsus2) G       A
Sister, let me be your servant,
D      Bm    Em        A
Let me be as Christ to you;
G         D     G        A
Pray that I may have the grace
   G       Em    G A      D
To let you be my servant, too.
