Am                F  E Am
There is a castle on a cloud,
Am                 G     C
I like to go there in my sleep.
G          Am               F
Aren't any floors for me to sweep,
Dm        C  G   F  E Am
Not in my castle on a cloud.

Am                     F    E  Am
There is a room that's full of toys,
Am                   G        C
There are my hundred boys and girls.
G      Am                  F
Nobody shouts or talks too loud,
Dm        C  G   F  E Am
Not in my castle on a cloud.

F               C
There is a lady all in white,
F                    C
Holds me and sings a lullaby.
      Bb                     F
She's nice to see, and she's soft to touch;
    E                               E7
She says: "Cosette, I love you very much."

Am                   F  E     Am
I know a place where no one's lost,
Am                   G      C
I know a place where no one cries.
G         Am           F
Crying at all is not allowed,
Dm        C  G   F  E Am
Not in my castle on a cloud.
