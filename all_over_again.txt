All Over Again
 - by Johnny Cash, tenor range D3-D4 in C

C                                                 G7
Every time I look at you I fall in love, all over again.
                                                  C
Every time I think of you it all begins, all over again.

F
One little dream at night and I can dream all day,
   C
It only takes your memory to thrill me.
F
One little kiss from you and I just fly away,
C                               G    G7
Pour me out your love until you fill me.

  C                                            C7        F
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again.
                (Dm7)         C      G7        C
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again.


(Repeat from "One little dream...")
