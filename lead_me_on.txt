Intro: Bb6 C G  Bb6 C G

Bb6      C      G
Shoulder to the wheel
    Bb6             C       G
For someone else's selfish gain
Bb6               C
Here there is no choosing
     D      Em
Working the clay
              D C                   G?
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.


Bb6  C      G
Fire in the field
Bb6          C       G
Underneath a blazing sun
    Bb6              C
But soon the sun was faded
    D(B7?)        Em
And freedom was a song
             D   C                     G                        
I heard them singing when the day was done
(G)
Singing to the holy one.


D       Em        Csus2
Lead me on. Lead me on
                     D     ?
To a place where the river runs
?
Into your keeping, oh.


?
Lead me on. Lead me on
?             D
The awaited deliverance
Em           Fsus2
Comforts the seeking...lead on.



Waiting for the train

Labelled with a golden star

Heavy hearted boarding

Whispers in the dark

"where are we going--is it very far? "


Bb6     C       G
Bitter cold terrain
Bb6          C        G
Echoes of a slamming door
?                                   D  Em
In chambers made for sleeping, forever
     D      C                   G?
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
?
Cry to the lord.



Lead me on. Lead me on

To a place where the river runs

Into your keeping, oh.



Lead me on. Lead me on

The awaited deliverance

Comforts the seeking...lead on.


?          C2
Man hurts man
         Bm           Em
Time and time, time again
       Em7                      Fsus2
And we drown in the wake of our power
?                 Dsus4 ...?...  Dsus4  Em7  Cadd2  
Somebody tell me why.


D       Em        Csus2
Lead me on. Lead me on
                     D
To a place where the river runs
Em        C
Into your keeping, oh.


D       Em        Csus2
Lead me on. Lead me on
??            D
The awaited deliverance
Em           Fsus2
Comforts the seeking...lead on.



Lead me on. Lead me on

To a place where the river runs

Into your keeping, oh.



Lead me on. Lead me on

The awaited deliverance

Comforts the seeking...lead on.
