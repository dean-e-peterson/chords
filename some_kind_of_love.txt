Some Kind of Love
 - by John Stewart, some words possibly mis-heard by Dean, 3/4 ~128-130 bpm in D

Intro: D A Bm (A) D A Bm (A)

D            A                Bm
Some kind of love shines like gold.
G               A          D
That kind's the hardest to hold;
                   F#          Bm            G
For it catches the eye of each thief passing by,
D            A                Bm  (A)
Some kind of love shines like gold.

D            A                Bm
Some kind of love breaks your heart,
           G           A               D
Though you knew it was doomed from the start.
             F#      Bm        G
As well to explain a moth to a flame,
D            A                Bm
Some kind of love breaks your heart.

CHORUS:
G                  F#m
Some kind of love, some kind of love,
G          D             A            Bm
Everyone's searching for some kind of love.
G                  F#m
Some kind of love, some kind of love,
G          D             A            D
Everyone's searching for some kind of love.

(Some kind of love comes too soon,
 That kind of love heals your wounds;
 When your wounds are all healed, and you're back on your wheel,
 You'll say that kind of love comes too soon.)

D            A              Bm
Some kind of love starts as friends,
G            A          D
That kind of love never ends;
                  F#        Bm              G
For it starts out slow like flowers through snow,
D            A              Bm  (A)
Some kind of love starts as friends.

D            A          Bm
Some kind of love never dies,
G               A          D
That kind's the hardest to find,
                         F#        Bm           G
For through laughter and tears, it mellows with years;
D            A          Bm
Some kind of love never dies.

CHORUS

(Some kind of love shines like gold, and that kind's the hardest to hold; For it
 catches the eye of each thief passing by, some kind of love shines like gold.)

(Alternate words to 2nd verse?:
 Some kind of love tears your heart, for you knew it was wrong from the start.
 Ah, but try to explain a moth to a flame, some kind of love tears your heart.)
(Alternate words other: For through laughter and rage, it mellows with age.)
