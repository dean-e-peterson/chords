E                                 A
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,
                     E                                    A
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
                        E                 A
They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain,
                   E                                        A
They sent you on a treadmill, and they made you change your name.

REFRAIN:

       B                          B7
And it seems to me you lived your life
       E             A
Like a candle in the wind,
      E                                B
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in,
      A                                          C#m
And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid.
                       B                A             E
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.


E                                 A
Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played.
                    E                                     A
Hollywood created a superstar, and pain was the price you paid.
                  E             A
And even when you died, Oh, the press still hounded you,
               E                                            A
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude.

(Refrain)

E                                 A
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,
                     E                                    A
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
                           E                       A
Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row
                                    E                                     A
Who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe.

(Refrain)
