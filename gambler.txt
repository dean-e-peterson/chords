The Gambler
 - by Don Schlitz, performed by Kenny Rogers
 - first part actually in Eb, then it key changes to E

     E                          A               E
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
                                                     B7
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   E                               A             E
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     A           E       B7               E
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.

         E                             A                E
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
                                                             B7
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       E                               A                 E
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      A             E       B7                    E
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice."

     E                           A                  E
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
                                              B7
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
        E                                A                 E
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                 A                    E             B7               E
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.


CHORUS:
           E                     A             E
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
A            E                          B7
know when to walk away and know when to run.
          E     A    E                 A              E
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
            A               E       B7                 E
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.


E                            A             E
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
                                                  B7
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       E                         A              E
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,
        A                 E              B7          E
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."

    E                               A                       E
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
A               E                          B7
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    E                             A                 E
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    A            E                B                E
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
