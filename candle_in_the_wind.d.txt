D                                 G
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,
                     D                                    G
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
                        D                 G
They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain,
                   D                                        G
They sent you on a treadmill, and they made you change your name.


REFRAIN:
       A                          A7
And it seems to me you lived your life
       D             G
Like a candle in the wind,
      D                                A
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in,
      G                                          Bm
And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid.
                       A                G             D     G Gmaj7 Gadd5 D
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.


D                                 G
Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played.
                    D                                     G
Hollywood created a superstar, and pain was the price you paid.
                  D             G
And even when you died, Oh, the press still hounded you,
               D                                            G
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude.


(Refrain)


D                                 G
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,
                     D                                    G
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
                           D                       G
Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row
                                    D                                     G
Who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe.


(Refrain)
