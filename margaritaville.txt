D
Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
                                   A
All of those tourists covered with oil.
A7
Strummin' my six string, on my front porch swing,
                                        D
Smell those shrimp they're beginning to boil.


G        A                  D
Wastin' away again in Margarita-ville,
G              A                D
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
G           A                    D A      G
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
           G D A             e---7--7--7--5--3--
But I know,                  b---8--8--8--7--5--

       A7     D    (A G D)   e---5--5--5--3--2--
It's nobody's fault.         b---7--7--7--5--3--


D
I don't know the reason, I stayed here all season,
                                   A
Nothin' to show but this brand new tatoo.
A7
But it's a real beautie, a Mexican cutie,
                                D
But how it got here I haven't a clue.


G        A                  D
Wastin' away again in Margarita-ville,
G              A                D
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
G           A                    D A      G
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
            G D A            A7    D    (A G D)
Now I think,      this could be my fault.


D
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop-top,
                                   A
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home.
A7
But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render,
                                         D
That frozen concotion that helps me hang on.


G        A                  D
Wastin' away again in Margarita-ville,
G              A                D
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
G           A                    D A      G
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
           G D A        A7       D    (A G D)
But I know,     it's my own damn fault.        (repeat last 2 lines)
