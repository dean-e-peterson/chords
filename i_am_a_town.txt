I'm a town in Carolina, I'm a detour on a ride,
      Cadd5                        Fadd9
For a phone call and a soda, I'm a blur from the driver's side,
        Am       F      Gsus4           Am    F Gsus4
I'm the last gas for an hour, if you're going 25,
     Am  F        Gsus4       Am       F       G
I am Texaco and tobacco, I am dust you leave behind.

     Cadd5                     Fadd9
I am peaches in September, and corn from a roadside stall,
        Cadd5                          Fadd9
I'm the language of the natives, I'm a cadence and a drawl,
        Am      F        Gsus4              Am     F           Gsus4
I'm the pines behind the graveyard, and the cool beneath their shade,
          Am        F          Gsus4           Am      F         G (Gsus4 G) 
Where the boys have left their beer cans, I am weeds between the graves.

  Am                                      F
    My porches sag and lean with old black man and children,
  Am                                       F
    My sleep is filled with dreams I never can fulfill them.

    I am a town.

      Cadd5                               Fadd9
I'm a church beside the highway where the ditches never drain.
      Cadd5                  Fadd9
I'm a Baptist like my daddy, Jesus knows my name.
     Am  F      Gsus4           Am     F      Gsus4
I am memory and stillness, I am lonely in old age.
     Am       F    Gsus4        Am       F     Gsus4
I am not your destination, I am clinging to my ways.
       Am  F  G
I am a town.

      Cadd5                  Fadd9
I'm a town in Carolina, I am billboards in the fields.
       Cadd5                        Fadd9
I'm an old truck up on cinderblocks missing all my wheels.
     Am         F        Gsus4  Am             F          Gsus4
I am Pabst Blue Ribbon, American and "Southern Serves the South".
     Am       F      Gsus4        Am     F       Gsus4
I am tucked behind a Jaycees sign on the rural route.
       Am  F  Gsus4
I am a town.
       Am  F  Gsus4
I am a town.
       Am  F  Gsus4     Am  F  Gsus4  (incorporate Dixie riff if possible)
I am a town.  Southbound.
