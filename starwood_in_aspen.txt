Starwood in Aspen
 - by John Denver, tenor range A2-C4? in C

       F (or Dm?)    G       C
It's a long way from L.A. to Denver,
       F            C           F
It's a long time to hang in the sky;
       F        Dm7     C           F
It's a long way home to Starwood in Aspen,
    C           F            C
The sweet Rocky Mountain paradise,
       F           C        G7  C
Oh, my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise.


    F             G              C
The springtime is rolling 'round slowly,
F              C           F
Gray skies are bringing me down.
        F                Dm7          C      F
Can't remember when I've ever been so lonely,
        C             F          C
I've forgot what it's like to be home,
        F                C    G7    C
Can't remember what it's like to be home.


  F           G            C
I think of my lady's sweet mem'ry,
  F           C                F
I think of my children's sweet smiles;
  F           Dm7     C           F
I think of my home at Starwood in Aspen,
       C               F            C
All my friends and the snow covered hills,
       F               C    G7      C
Oh, my friends are the snow covered hills.


      F            G        C
Can I tell you I'm happy to be here.
   F            C          F
To share and consider this time?
      F            Dm7        C       F
For I see here the shadows of changes,
      C          F              C
And a feeling of new friends to find,
      F             C           G7 C
And I see here some new friends to find.


       F (or Dm?)    G             C
It's a long way from this place to Denver,
       F            C           F
It's a long time to hang in the sky;
       F        Dm7     C           F
It's a long way home to Starwood in Aspen,
   C           F            C
My sweet Rocky Mountain paradise,
       F           C        G7  C
Oh, my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise.
