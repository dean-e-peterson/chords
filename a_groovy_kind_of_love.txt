Intro:  G  D/G  G  D/G

                 G                   D/G
When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
                  G                    Am/G
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue.
                     Am                  Bm
When you're close to me, I can feel your heart beat,
               C               D
I can hear you breathing in my ear...
              G                  D/G
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me,
                           G      D
we've got a groovy kind of love?

            G                        D/G
Anytime you want to, you can turn me on to
             G                   Am/G
Anything you want to, anytime at all.
                 Am                   Bm
When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver,
                  C           D
Can't control the quivering inside...
              G                  D/G
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me,
                     G      D
got a groovy kind of love?

...and then a key change happens...
  (G chord then A chord & instrumental verse in A?)

(D/A?            A                   E/A
When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
                  A                    Bm/A
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue.
                 Bm                     C#m
When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter,
                     D                E
My whole world could shatter, I don't care...
              A                  E/A
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me,
                     A      E/A

                           A     E/A
