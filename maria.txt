Intro?:  C/E  C#dim  Dm7  G7  C

    C                 Dm7                   F               Gadd9 G
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, her dress has got a tear.
    C              Dm7              F               G     E7 (or G7?)
She waltzes on her way to Mass, and whistles on the stair.
    Am             Am7/G          Am6/F#         F7
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair.
  C              F              Dm7  G7
I even heard her singing in the abbey.

      C               Dm7             F            Gadd9 G
She's always late for chapel, but her penitence is real.
      C               Dm7           F              G   E7/B
She's always late for everything, except for every meal.
  Am              Am7/G         Am6/F#      F7
I hate to have to say it, but I very firmly feel
   C/G         Am7          Dm6/F  E
Maria's not an asset to the abbey.
    Am7           D6            G        Am7 D(7)     G      G7
I'd like to say a word in her behalf.  Maria makes me laugh.


CHORUS:
C                                 G7
How do you solve a problem like Maria?
C                                   G G7
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
C                 Cmaj7(/E)         F
How do you find a word that means Maria?
  D7(/F#)            Fm                  Em G7
A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!

C                                   G7
Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her,
C                              Dm(/F)  (E7sus4  E7)
Many a thing she ought to understand.
(E7) Cm                            G7
But  how do you make her stay, and listen to all you say,
Cm                              G G7
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?
    C                                 Fmaj7 Dm7
Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
C          Cdim   Dm7      G7      C
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?


 (A cappella, or C for 2 lines then Am)
When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused,
And I never know exactly where I am.
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather.
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

(C7)     F      C7/G  F/A    C7/G    F      C7/G     F/A
She'd outpester any   pest,  drive a hornet from its nest.
C7/G      F       C7/G     F/A     C7/G   F  C7/G  F/A
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl.
       C        G7/D   C/E    F       C/E      G7/D    C
She is gentle!  She is wild!  She's a riddle!  She's a child!
        G                   D7              Dm7   G(7)
She's a headache!  She's an angel!  She's a girl!

(Chorus)
