Most people live on a lonely island,
F                             A
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea.
F                            Bb
Most people long for another island,
(Gm)                          Gm      C7
One where they know they will like to be.


     Fdim          F        Fdim       F
Bali Ha'i may call you, any night, any day,
        E                     Db7  F          Db7    C7    F
In your heart, you'll hear it call you: "Come away...Come away."


     Fdim          F          Fdim        F
Bali Ha'i will whisper in the wind of the sea:
         E               Db7  F             Db7 C7      F
"Here am I, your special is - land! Come to me, come to me!"


     Bb                      Bb+
Your own special hopes, your own special dreams,
Gm                        Bbm          C7
Bloom on the hillside and shine in the streams.


       Fdim             F             Fdim          F
If you try, you'll find me, where the sky meets the sea.
         E               Db7  F             Db7 C7      F F7
"Here am I, your special is - land! Come to me, come to me!"
     Bb6        C9         F6
Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i!


E(m)           Dm     Em              Dm
Someday you'll see me floatin' in the sunshine,
   Gm                                  F
My head stickin' out from a low flyin' cloud,
Gm             Dm
You'll hear me call you,
Gm                  Dm
Singin' through the sunshine,
Gb        Bb?          F?   (or  Gb  Ab  Bb?)
Sweet and clear as can be:
F        Fdim F       Fdim F       Fdim
"Come to me,  here am I,   come to me."


       Fdim             F             Fdim          F
If you try, you'll find me, where the sky meets the sea.
         E               Db7  F             Db7 C7      F F7
"Here am I, your special is - land! Come to me, come to me!"
     Bb6        C9         F6
Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i!
