Intro:  D  A G D

D       A   G    D  [etc.]
I see a bad moon rising.
I see trouble on the way.
I see earthquakes and lightnin'.
I see bad times today.


CHORUS:
G
Don't go around tonight.
           D
Well, it's bound to take your life.
A         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise.


I hear hurricanes a-blowing.
I know the end is coming soon.
I fear rivers overflowing.
I hear the voice of rage and ruin.

(CHORUS)

Hope you got your things together.
Hope you are quite prepared to die.
Looks like we're in for nasty weather.
One eye is taken for an eye.

(CHORUS)
