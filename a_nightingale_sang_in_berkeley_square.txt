E               F#m7    Am6      E      B7      E
When two lovers meet in Mayfair, so the legends tell,
F#m7 B9   E  Bdim   A6     B7       E
Songbirds sing;     winter turns to spring.
E             F#m7      Am6     E       F#m6 (G#7) C#m
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the  spell.
(Bdim)  B                         Em            B            F#         A6  B7
I       know such enchantment can be, 'cause it happened one evening to me:

     Emaj7   C#m7       G#m7     E7
That certain night, the night we met,
          A      G#7          C#m  Am6                             Am6     (x02212)
There was magic abroad in the air.                                 B9      (x21222)
           Emaj7  B7     E7     Am7                                Bdim    (xx0101)
There were angels dining at the Ritz,                              A6      (x02222)
(D7)  Emaj7       C#m7    F#m7 B7  E(6)  C#m7 F#m7 B7              F#m6    (xx1222)
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.                         Emaj7   (021100)?
                                                                   E6      (022120)?
  Emaj7  C#m7     G#m7   E7                                        Bbm7(b5?(x12120)?
I may be right. I may be wrong.                                    Eb7     (xx1323) or (xx5646)
        A        G#7         C#m  Am6                              Eb9     (x11021)?or (xx1021)
But I'm perfectly willing to swear,                                Eb11    (x66666)
     Emaj7    B7         E7        Am7                             C#7     (x46464) or (xx3424)
That when you turned and smiled at me,                             F#m7(b5)(xx2212)
(D7) Emaj7       C#m7    F#m7 B7  E(6)  C#m7  Bbm7(b5) Eb7         G#m7(b5)(xx4434)
A    nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.                          Fm6     (xx0111)
                                                                   Gdim    (xx2323)
                                                                   Em7(b5) (012030)
BRIDGE:                                                            Dm7(b5) (xx0111)
G#            Fm7           Bbm7        Eb9? or Eb11?
The moon that lingered over London town,
     Cm7     Bdim     Bbm7   Eb7
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.
G#           Fm7              Bbm7  Eb9? or Eb11?
How could he know we two were so in love?
    Cm7        Bdim         F#m7   B7
The whole darn world seemed upside down.

    Emaj7      C#m7      G#m7       E7
The streets of town were paved with stars;
       A        G#7      C#m  Am6
It was such a romantic affair.                               Chords in C...
     Emaj7  B7         E7        Am7                         Intro:
And, as we  kissed and said 'goodnight',                        C  Dm7  Fm6  C  G7  C
(D7) Emaj7       C#m7    F#m7 B7  E(6)  C#m7    F#m7 B7         Dm7  G9  C  Gdim  F6  G7  C
A    nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.                       C  Dm7  Fm6  C  Dm6  (E7)  Am
                                                                (Gdim) G (?) Cm  G  D  F6  G7
How strange it was, how sweet and strange,                   Verse:
There was never a dream to compare,                             Cmaj7  Am7  Em7  C7
With that hazy, crazy night we met,                             F  E7  Am  Fm6
When a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.                     Cmaj7  G7  C7  Fm7
                                                                Bb7  Cmaj7  Am7  Dm7  G7  C(6)
This heart of mine, it beat loud and fast,                        Am7  Dm7  G7
Like a merry-go-round in a fair,                             Verse transition into bridge:
For we were dancing cheek to cheek,                             Bb7  Cmaj7  Am7  Dm7  G7  C(6)
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.                        Am7  F#m7(b5)  B7
                                                             Bridge:
(Bridge chords)                                                 E  C#m7  F#m7  B9?
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue,                   G#m7  Gdim  F#m7  B7
To interrupt our rendezvous,                                    E  C#m7  F#m7  B9?
I still remember how you smiled and said,                       G#m7  Gdim  Dm7  G7
"Was that a dream or was it true?"                           Ending:
                                                                Dm7  G7  Em7(b5)  A7
Our homeward step was just as light,                            Dm7(b5)  F  G7  C(6)
As the (tap-)dancing feet of Astaire.                             Am7  Dm7  Fm6  Fm  Cmaj7
And, like an echo far away,
(D7) Emaj7       C#m7    F#m7 B7  E(6)  C#m7
A    nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.

F#m7        B7    G#m7(b5) C#7    F#m7(b5)      A    B7  E(6)  C#m7  F#m7  Am6  Am  Emaj7
I know 'cos I was there,          that night in Berkeley Square.
