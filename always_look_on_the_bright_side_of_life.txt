     Am                 D            G               Em
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
      Am                   D         G
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Am                D
When you've chewing an life's gristle
      G              Em
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Am                                   D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best
 
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
   G   Em          Am    D7      G     Em    Am    D7
Always look on the light side of life
   Am               D              G                Em
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
              Am                  D         G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Am             D              G     Em
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Am                                       D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing
 
And always look on the bright side of life.
Come on, always look on the bright side of life.
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word.
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.
 
So, always look on the bright side of death.
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
You'll see it's all a show - keep'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
    G      Em          Am     D7      G     Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
G      Em          Am    D7      G      Em    Am    D7
Always look on the right side of life
(Come on guys, cheer up)
