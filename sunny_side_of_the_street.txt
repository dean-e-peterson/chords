Intro:  G7

G7        C                 E7              F            G7
Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry on the doorstep,
Am               D7   (D7-5 D7)  Dm7     G7        C
Just direct your feet  to   the  sunny side of the street.


G7        C            E7             F             G7
Can't you hear a pitterpat?  And that happy tune is your step,
Am             D7    (D7-5 D7)  Dm7     G7        C
Life can be so sweet  on   the  sunny side of the street.


  Fm6  Cdim C7   Gm7     C7  (Cdim) C7    F6    C9     F6
I used to   walk in the shade with  those blues on parade,
F   D7  Am7     D7       G7    Gdim    G7
But I'm not afraid, this rover crossed over.


     C            E7           F            G7
If I never have a cent I'll be rich as Rockefeller,
Am              D7   (D7-5 D7)  Dm7     G7        C     Gdim  G7
Gold dust at my feet, on   the  sunny side of the street.


(Repeat from beginning, 2nd ending replace last line with...)

Am              D7   (D7-5 D7)  Dm7     G7
Gold dust at my feet, on   the  sunny side,
       G     A(7)         Dm7     G7        C      (Fm6  C)
On the sunny side, on the sunny side of the street.
