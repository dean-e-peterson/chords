A      A7 D7        G  (Gmaj7) Em
There's a place for us,
    A7      D7        G
Somewhere a place for us.
A         A7        F#m  Bm
Peace and quiet and open air
G        C  A
Wait for us somewhere.


A      A7 D7       G  (Gmaj7) Em
There's a time for us,
    A7    D7       G
Someday a time for us,
A      A7          F#m     Bm
Time together with time to spare,
G       C      Am      F
Time to learn, time to care.
Bb       Gm
Someday, somewhere.


Dm                      Em7
We'll find a new way of living,
Bb           Gm        F       E     (C#m7)
We'll find a way of forgiving, somewhere.


A      A7 D7        G  (Gmaj7) Em
There's a place for us,
  A7       D7        G
A time and place for us.
A       A7             F#m     Bm
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.
G       C             Am       F
Hold my hand and I'll take you there,
Bb       Gm       D    (D7 G)
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere.
