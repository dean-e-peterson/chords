[Verse 1]
  Em                         Am
I ache for the touch of your lips, dear
         D7                         G
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
B7                       Em     Am
You can raise welts like nobody else
      B7                     Em
As we dance to the masochism tango

[Verse 2]
        Em                      Am
Let our love be a flame, not an ember
         D7                     G
Say it's me that you want to dismember
B7                  Em         Am
Blacken my eye, set fire to my tie
      B7                     Em
As we dance to the masochism tango

[Chorus]
           Am     D7              G
At your command before you here I stand
   Em             Am
My heart is in my hand (yehk)
     Ebdim7           E  E7
It's here that I must be
           Am           D7                G
My heart entreats, just hear those savage beats
    Em             Am         D7               G   B7
And go put on your cleats and come and trample me

[Verse 3]
     Em                          Am
Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
           D7                    G
That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
   B7                     Em         Am
My soul is on fire, it's aflame with desire
         B7                     Em
Which is why I perspire when we tango

[Bridge]
              C  Cmaj7  C7
You caught my nose
                  F
In your left castanet, love
                    B7
I can feel the pain yet, love
                  Em
Ev'ry time I hear drums
               C     C7
And I envy the rose
                      F
That you held in your teeth, love
                     B7
With the thorns underneath, love
                   Em    B7
Sticking into your gums

[Verse 4]
     Em                       Am
Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
    D7                        G
The last time I needed twenty stitches
   B7                       Em             Am
To sew up the gash that you made with your lash
      B7                      Em
As we danced to the masochism tango

[Chorus]
           Am        D7                  G
Bash in my brain and make me scream with pain
     Em            Am       Ebdim7          E  E7
Then kick me once again and say we'll never part
           Am       D7              G
I know too well I'm underneath your spell
    Em              Am              D7               G    B7
So, darling, if you smell something burning, it's my heart

[Verse 5]
     Em                      Am
Take your cigarette from its holder
    D7                       G
And burn your initials in my shoulder
B7                    Em                Am
Fracture my spine and swear that you're mine
      B7                     Em
As we dance to the masochism tango
