Intro: G A C D7

G         A              C D
It is the evening of the day
G         A                  C D
I sit and watch the children play
C             D
Smiling faces I can see
G   D       Em
but not for me
C                           D7
I sit and watch as tears go by


G         A              C D
My riches can't buy everything
G         A                C D
I want to hear to children sing
C          D
all I here is the sound
G               D      Em
of rain falling on the ground
C                           D7
I sit and watch as tears go by


(Instrumental verse)


G         A              C D
It is the evening of the day
G         A                  C D
I sit and watch the children play
C              D
doing things I used to do
G    D         Em
they think are new
C                           D7
I sit and watch as tears go by
