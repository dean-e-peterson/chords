E  Am          Fmaj7      C         D  E
I  wonder as I wander out under the sky,

    Am        Fmaj7       Fmaj7-9     Fmaj7
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die.

    Am         Fmaj7       D7           G
For poor on'ry people like you and like I;

Em Am     Am7  Am6        Fmaj7 C   D  E
I  wonder as I wander out under the sky.


E    Am           Fmaj7       C          D    E
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall,

     Am           Fmaj7       Fmaj7-9       Fmaj7
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all,

    Am              Fmaj7     D7               G
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall,

Em      Am     Am7 Am6     Fmaj7    C D   E
And the promise of ages it then did recall.


E  Am        Fmaj7      C       D    E
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing,

  Am          Fmaj7    Fmaj7-9     Fmaj7
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing,

   Am           Fmaj7     D7        G
Or all of God's angels in heaven to sing,

Em Am     Am7   Am6             Fmaj7  C   D   E
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.


E  Am          Fmaj7      C         D  E
I  wonder as I wander out under the sky,

    Am        Fmaj7       Fmaj7-9     Fmaj7
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die,

    Am         Fmaj7       D7           G
For poor on'ry people like you and like I;

Em Am     Am7  Am6        Fmaj7 C   D  E        Am
I  wonder as I wander out under the sky.
