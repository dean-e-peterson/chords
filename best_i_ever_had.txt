Intro:  G  Am7  C2  G  D/F# (x2)

G              Am7   C2            G  D/F#
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning.
G               Am7   C2             G D/F#
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring.
Am                Em       Am               Em   D
Nothing quite the same now; I just say your name now.

(Chorus:)
G               Am7  C2          G      D/F# Em
But it's not so bad, you're only best I ever had.
                  Am     C2              G      D/F# G  Am7  C2
You don't want me back.  You're just the best I ever had.


G               Am7    C2             G D/F#
So you stole my world. Now I'm just a phony.
G               Am7  C2                 G  D/F#
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely.
Am               Em  Am             Em   D
Send it in a letter; make your self better.

(Chorus:)
G               Am7  C2          G      D/F# Em
But it's not so bad, you're only best I ever had.
                  Am     C2              G      D/F# G  Am7  C2
You don't want me back.  You're just the best I ever had.


(Bridge:)
           G                 C     G        Am
And it may take some time to patch me up inside,
F         G            C2  G         Am
But I can take it so I run away and hide,
F         G                 C           G    Am
And I may find in time that you were always right,
       Em      C2       D
You're always right.


G              Am7 C2                G   D/F#
So you sailed away into our grey sky morning.
G               Am7   C2             G  D/F#
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring.
Am              Em      Am              Em    D
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?

(Chorus:)
G               Am7  C2          G      D/F# Em
But it's not so bad, you're only best I ever had.
                  Am   C2                              G      Em   G
I don't want me back.  You're just the You're just the best I ever had.

G  Am7  C2  G  D/F#  (x2, end it with)  G
