[Intro]

[Topher]
        G              D7sus/A  D7
    Ten minutes ago, I saw you
             G                            D7sus/A  D7
    I looked up when you came through the door
       G            B7           Em          Cm(6)
    My head started reeling, you gave me the feeling
        G           A7         D7
    The room had no ceiling or floor

[Topher]
        G              D7sus/A  D7
    Ten minutes ago, I met you
           G                        D7sus/A  D7
    And we murmured our "How do you do's?"
      G         B7           Em         Cm(6)        G/D
    I wanted to ring out the bells, and fling out my arms
           D7           G  (G7)
    And to sing out the news
            C       C/G         G/B  G/D
    "I have found her, she's an angel
             Am7         D7           G  (G7)
    With the dust of the stars in her eyes
           C     C/G       G/B  G/D
    We are dancing, we are flying
              A9/E      A           Am7/D  D7
    And she's taking me back to the skies"

[Topher]
           G                    D7sus/A  D7
    In the arms of my love, I'm flying
         G                       D7sus/A  D7
    Over mountain and meadow and glen
          G          B7             Em        Cm(6)
    And I like it so well, that for all I can tell
          G/D        D7    Dm7  G7
    I may never come down again
          C          Am7     Am7/D  D7  G
    I may never come down to earth  a - gain

[Ella]

    And we murmured our "How do you do's?"
      G         B7           Em         Cm(6)        G/D
    I wanted to ring out the bells, and fling out my arms
           D7           G  (G7)
    And to sing out the news
           C       C/G       G/B       G/D
    I have found him, I have found him

    I may never come down again
