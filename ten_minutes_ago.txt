[Intro]
G/D D/C G/B D7/A
 
[Topher]
    G              D7sus/A
Ten minutes ago, I saw you
D7        G                            D7sus/A
 I looked up when you came through the door
D7  G            B7
 My head started reeling
    Em          Cm6
You gave me the feeling
 
The room had no ceiling or floor
 
[Topher]
D7   G              D7sus/A
 Ten minutes ago, I met you
D7      G                        D7sus/A
 And we murmured our "How do you do's?"
D7 G         B7           Em
 I wanted to ring out the bells
    Cm6          G/D
And fling out my arms
       D7           G
And to sing out the news
F/G G7   C       C/G      G/B      G/D
"I  have found her, she's an angel
         Am7         D7           G
With the dust of the stars in her eyes
G F/G G7 C       C/G      G/B    G/D
  We  are dancing, we are flying
          A9/E      A    G  A7  Am7/D
And she's taking me back to the skies"
 
[Topher]
D7      G                    D7sus/A
 In the arms of my love, I'm flying
D7    G                       D7sus/A
 Over mountain and meadow and glen
D7     G          B7
 And I like it so well
         Em        Cm6
That for all I can tell
      G/D        D7    Dm7
I may never come down again
G7     C          Am7     Am7/D D7 Em7
 I may never come down to earth again
 
[Ella]
D7   G              D7sus/A
 Ten minutes ago, I met you
D7      G                        D7sus/A
 And we murmured our "How do you do's?"
D7 G         B7           Em
 I wanted to ring out the bells
    Cm6          G/D
And fling out my arms
       D7           G
And to sing out the news
F/G G7   C       C/G       G/B       G/D
I   have found him, I have found him

D7      G                    D7sus/A
 In the arms of my love, I'm flying
D7    G                       D7sus/A
 Over mountain and meadow and glen
D7     G          B7
 And I like it so well
         Em        Cm6
That for all I can tell
      G/D        D7    Dm7
I may never come down again
 
[Ella & Topher]

 I may never come down to earth again
