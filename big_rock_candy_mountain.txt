INTRO:
    C
One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning,

Down the track came a hobo hikin' and he said, "Boys, I'm not turning.
    F            C           F    C      F                G7
I'm headed for a land that's far away, beside the crystal fountains,
    C                                            G7    C
So, come with me, we'll go and see, the Big Rock Candy Mountains."

VERSES:
C                                         F                    C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright,
          F                C               F               G7
Where the handouts grow on bushes, and you sleep out every night,
          C                              F               C
Where the boxcars all are empty, and the sun shines everyday,
       F             C            F         C
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees,
    F        C                 F        C            G7             C
The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                       F                C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs,
        F                 C                     F                    G7
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth, and the hens lay soft boiled eggs.
    C                                        F                 C
The farmers' trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay.
        F        C              F        C
Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow,
          F          C            F          C           G7             C
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                   F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks,
        F                 C              F                  G7
And the little streams of alcohol come a-tricklin' down the rocks,
      C                                  F              C
There ain't no short-handled shovels, no axes, saws, or picks,
      F        C               F         C
I'm a-going to stay, where you sleep all day,
           F        C           F      C            G7             C
Where they hung the jerk, who invented work, in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                    F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, the jails are made of tin,
    F                  C             F               G7
And you can walk right out again, as soon as you are in.
    C                                       F                  C
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind.
          F       C            F       C
There's a lake of stew, and of whiskey too,
        F            C              F     C          G7             C
You can paddle all a round 'em in a big canoe in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
