INTRO:
    C
One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning,

Down the track came a hobo hikin' and he said, "Boys, I'm not turning.
    F            C           F    C      F                G7
I'm headed for a land that's far away, beside the crystal fountains,
    C                                            G7    C
So, come with me, we'll go and see, the Big Rock Candy Mountains."

VERSES:
C                                         F                    C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright,
          F                C               F               G7
Where the handouts grow on bushes, and you sleep out every night,
          C                              F               C
Where the boxcars all are empty, and the sun shines everyday,
       F             C            F         C
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees,
    F        C                 F        C            G7             C
The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                       F                C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs,
        F                 C                     F                    G7
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth, and the hens lay soft boiled eggs.
    C                                        F                 C
The farmers' trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay.
        F        C              F        C
Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow,
          F          C            F          C           G7             C
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                   F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks,
        F                 C              F                  G7
And the little streams of alcohol come a-tricklin' down the rocks,
      C                                  F              C
There ain't no short-handled shovels, no axes, saws, or picks,
      F        C               F         C
I'm a-going to stay, where you sleep all day,
           F        C           F      C            G7             C
Where they hung the jerk, who invented work, in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

C                                    F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, the jails are made of tin,
    F                  C             F               G7
And you can walk right out again, as soon as you are in.
    C                                       F                  C
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind.
          F       C            F       C
There's a lake of stew, and of whiskey too,
        F            C              F     C          G7             C
You can paddle all a round 'em in a big canoe in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

Alternate Lyrics
- as sung by Billy Dalton 1929 (https://youtu.be/txo9_E844sk)

One night just as the sun went down, a bunch of bums were gabbin'.
They were seated round their jungle fire, ?twas a fast train they did grabbin'?
Then old Andy Lang of the Lakeshore Gang said, boys you know I'm countin'
Each day and week until I see the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

On the Big Rock Candy Mountain, where the skies are always clear,
Where the whiskey flows from fountains.  If it rains, it rains cold beer.
Where the corned beef grows on bushes, where sign poems? welcome here.
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarrette trees,
And the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings on the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

On the Big Rock Candy Mountain, it's the only place I know,
Where hotels beg to feed you, and they never take your doe.
Then they try to make you live there, 'cause they hate to see you go,
And they buy you wine, so you have a gay time,
And a little tummy ache, from a nice juicy steak, on the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

On a Big Rock Candy Mountain, all the cops have wooden legs,
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth, and the hens lay scrambled eggs.
All the orchards, they are full of fruit, and the barns are full of hay.
Indeed I got to go to the land of snow, where they hung the Turk who invented work,
On the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

On the Big Rock Candy Mountain, there's a cabaret made for bums,
Where you lean on downy pillows, while a hula maiden strums,
Where the swell Jane? writes? beside you breaking up a tub of mums,
Even thousand dollar bills, up green little hills,
And your pokies in a bim? full of diamond pims?, on the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

On a Big Rock Candy Mountain, where there ain't much work to do.
You'll could sleep and keep all seasons, for no one will bother you.
All the folks wear padded slippers, and the sound of soup's? taboo,
No knowledge by the law, but the happy bum's store?,
Or the bump on the head, as he falls out of bed, on the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
