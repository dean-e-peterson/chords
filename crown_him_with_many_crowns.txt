Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.
      D       Bm       E      A   (Asus4 A)    E       A  (A7)
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own.
 D        (D2   D)  G Gmaj7 E       (E7)     A   (A7)
Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee,
    D         G D   Em   A    D            G    Asus A D
And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity.


D                     G       D        Em        A
Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side,
      D           Bm  E    A (Asus4 A)     E    A   (A7)
Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified.
    D   (D2 D)  G Gmaj7 E     (E7)      A    (A7)
No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,
    D         G    D   Em  A   D      G    Asus A  D
But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.


D                     G         D         Em       A
Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed o'er the grave,
    D       Bm      E      A   (Asus4 A)       E       A   (A7)
And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save.
    D       (D2 D) G Gmaj7   E         (E7)    A   (A7)
His glories now we sing, who died, and rose on high,
    D         G D Em  A  D          G          Asus  A   D
Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.


D                     G           D        Em     A
Crown Him the Lord of heaven: One with the Father known,
    D        Bm     E           A   (Asus4 A)     E        A    (A7)
One with the Spirit through Him given from yonder glorious throne.
    D      (D2 D)   G Gmaj7   E        (E7)      A  (A7)
All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me;
    D          G  D  Em    A   D           G    Asus A D
Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.


D                     G          D    Em       A
Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign,
    D       Bm           E       A  (Asus4 A)       E       A   (A7)
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain,
    D        (D2    D) G  Gmaj7     E           (E7)   A   (A7)
Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing
      D         G  D   Em  A   D            G      Asus A  D
Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.


D                     G          D    Em      A
Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time,
   D    Bm     E       A    (Asus4 A) E      A  (A7)
Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime.
    D      (D2 D)   G Gmaj7    E        (E7)     A  (A7)
All hail, Redeemer, hail!  For Thou has died for me;
    D          G  D  Em    A   D           G    Asus A D
Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.
