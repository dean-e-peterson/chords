Em          (Em2       Em          Em2)
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Cmaj7
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,
Am7         B9 (or D7) G            C(/E)
Brown paper packages   tied up with strings,
G           C         F#m7b5 (or Am) B7
These are a few of my favorite       things.

Em           (Em2        Em          Em2)
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels,
Cmaj7
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,
Am7             B9 (or D7)   G             C(/E)
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings,
G           C         F#m7b5 (or Am) B7
These are a few of my favorite       things.

E             (E2           E          E2)
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,
A              (A6         A           A6)
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Am7          B9 (or D7)   G             C(/E)
Silver white winters that melt into springs,
G           C         F#m7b5 (or Am) B7(?)
These are a few of my favorite       things.

Em
When the dog bites,
Am (or F#m7b5) B7
When the bee   stings,
Em       Em7     C
When I'm feeling sad,
  Am7                A
I simply remember my favorite things
    G                D#dim (or D7b9?)  D7 G    D7 G
And then I don't feel                  so bad.
