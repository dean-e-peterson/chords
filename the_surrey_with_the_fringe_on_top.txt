You will set behind a team of snow white horses, In the slickest gig you ever see!

G          Gmaj7     G6           G(maj7)
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry                                 Gmaj7   (320002)
G      Gmaj7    G6         Gmaj7                                         G6      (320000)

Watch that fringe and see how it flutters                                C#      (x46664)
G      Gmaj7      G6            Gmaj7                                    Ab7     (464544)

G     Gmaj7    G6               G                  Em7  A9   Am7         Gm      (355333)
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!

    G7                       C
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
    Gm6         G7      C
The dashboard's genuine leather,
     A7                        D
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
   Em9            A7            Am7  D7
In case there's a change in the weather.

G          Gmaj7       G6          G(maj7)
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
G        Gmaj7 G6        Gmaj7
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
G       Gmaj7     G6            G                Am   E7 Am
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
         G             Gmaj7           Am     D7     G  C  G
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

C#     Ab7    C#    Ab7     Bb         Cm7 F7   G          D7       G       D7        G
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?  One's like snow the other's more like milk.

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we ride back home in the surrey,
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!
