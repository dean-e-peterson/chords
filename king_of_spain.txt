Once I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)

Oh... my unspeakable wife, Queen Lisa.  (Now I eat humble pie.)

I'm telling you I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
F#                    C#    F#
And now I work at the Pizza Pizza.  (1, 2, 3, 4!)
F#          B   F#   C#         F#
Bah-dap-bap-bah-dah, bap-ba-dap-dap.

F#                      B
Royalty, lord it looked good on me,
                            F#         C#            F#
Buried in silk in the royal boudoir or going nuclear free,
                                          B
Or playing Crokinole with the Princess of Monaco,
                        F#            C#                F#
Telling my jokes to the OPEC leaders, getting it all on video.

Once I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
A palatial palace, that was my home.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
And now I vacuum the turf at SkyDome.  (Once he was the King of Spain.)

F#                         B
I can't wait, I'm lowering interest rates, my people say:
                          F#
"King, how are you such a genius?
          C#                 F#
There's a roof overhead, and food on our plates!"
F#                               B
It's laissez-faire, I don't even give a care.
                              F#                C#               F#
Let's make Friday part of the weekend, and give every new baby a chocolate eclair.

Once I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
Hey Clinton! Hey Yeltsin! Got problems? You phone me.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
Now the Leafs call me up to drive the Zamboni.  (Once he was the King of Spain.)

F#
(spoken) Ladies and Gentlemen, I introduce to you the international orchestra!

(spoken) Now some of you might be wondering how I came to be living in Canada,
         after being royalty in Spain. Should I tell them, guys?  (Tell us, King!)

        F#                                  B
You see late one night when the palace was asleep,
                F#           C#                F#
Out of my royal chambers and into the garden I creep.
                                                                  B
And I wait till the appointed time, when the moon is lighting the pitch,
                                            F#
At which point my peasant friend, who looks just like me
  C#                F#
Arrives and we make switch!  (Gasp!)

F#
Prince and pauper, junior and whopper,
                 B
World made up of silver and copper.
               F#      C#                   F#
Under my own volition, I took a change of position.
F#                            B
So next time you drool in the pizza line,
                              F#              C#                  F#
Remember, slower pizza's more luscious.  (The King of Spain never rushes!!!)

Once I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
I was lookin' for off-handed ways to improve us.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain.  (Now I eat humble pie.)
And now I'm jamming with Moxy Fruvous!  (Once he was the King of Spain.)
