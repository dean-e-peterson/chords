G        D    Am           C         G           D        Am   C
Closing time, open all the doors and let you out into the world
G        D    Am              C              G             D     Am   C
Closing time, turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl
G        D    Am                C           G           D          Am   C
Closing time, one last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer
G        D    Am                C                G       D  Am   C
Closing time, you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here


CHORUS:
G       D     Am                C
I know who I want to take me home
G       D     Am                C
I know who I want to take me home
G       D     Am             C
I know who I want to take me home
        G    D    Am    C
Take me home.


G        D    Am              C             G          D       Am   C
Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from
G        D    Am                 C              G                D       Am  C
Closing time, this room won't be open till your brothers or your sisters come
   G               D       Am             C        G             D       Am   C
So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits, I hope you have found a friend.
G        D    Am          C                  G            D         Am   C
Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end, yeah.
