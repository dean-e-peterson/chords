Calypso (in E)
 - by John Denver

D6      (xx0202)
Amaj7   (x02120)
A11?    (x00000)

   E
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,
                          (Emaj7)     A6
to ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
   E
To work in the service of life and living,
                                      A6
In search of the answers of questions unknown
      E
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,
                          A11 (or Em7 or Em)
Part of beginning to understand,


(Chorus)
A               E
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    A                  E
The things that you've shown us,
    B            E
The stories you tell,
A              E
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    A            E             B           E
The men who have served you so long and so well
       B     A   E       B
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh
A                 E          B
oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee
E       B  Asus4  A  E
doo-dle ay ee


E                                    (Emaj7)
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you,
                             (Emaj7)     A6
To light up the darkness and show us the way,
    E
For though we are strangers in your silent world,
                                           A6
To live on the land we must learn from the sea,
      E
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell,
                                A11 (or Em7 or Em)
Joyful and loving in letting it be,


(Chorus)
A               E
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
    A                  E
The things that you've shown us,
    B           E
The stories you tell,
A              E
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
    A            E             B           E
Yhe men who have served you so long and so well
       B     A   E       B
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh
A                 E          B
oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee
E       B  Asus4  A  E
doo-dle ay ee
