Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you.
Dm     C     Dm C        Dm C      Dm  (G) Cadd5
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new.
F    G(add9)  Em   F              G(add9)  Em  Em7
Flashback,    warm nights, almost left   behind.
F   G(add9)  Em  F           G
Suitcase of  memories.  Time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead.
Dm     C       Dm C     Dm    C         Dm (G) Cadd5
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said.
     F   G(add9)  Em F       G(add9)  Em  Em7
Then you say,     go slow, I fall   behind.

       G                                   Am   F    G     C
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting, time after time.

Af-ter my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray.
Dm   C           Dm C            Dm    C      Dm (G) Cadd5
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK.
F  G(add9)  Em F        G(add9)  Em  Em7
Secrets     stolen from deep   inside.

The drum beats out of time.
