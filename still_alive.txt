Bm         D      Bm  D     Bm       D          Bm      D     Bm
This was a triumph;     I'm making a note here: huge success.
     Em          A             D       Bm  D
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Bm       D      Bm  D    Bm         D      Bm       D   Bm
Aperture Science:     We do what we must because we can,
Em              A                     Bbmaj7
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead...

            F        C           Bb       F
But there's no sense crying over every mistake,
         F       C               Bb         F
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake,
        Gm           C             F      (C)  Dm
And the science gets done, and you make a neat gun
        Bb         A          D    Bm  D
For the people who are still alive.


    Bm       D    Bm  D  Bm        D     Bm         D    Bm
I'm not even angry;      I'm being so sincere right now,
Em              A                  D         Bm  D
Even though you broke my heart and killed me,
    Bm         D     Bm  D     Bm          D       Bm   D   Bm
And tore me to pieces,     and threw every piece into a fire.
Em                A                     Bbmaj7
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you...

          F         C           Bb        F
Now these points of data make a beautiful line,
          F      C             Bb         F
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.
       Gm         C                F       (C)       Dm
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
        Bb         A          D    Bm  D
For the people who are still alive.


Bm                 D       Bm  D   Bm           D      Bm     D    Bm
Go ahead (on?) and leave me.     I think I'd prefer to stay inside.
Em                A               D        Bm  D
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Bm          D   Bm  D  Bm         D        Bm      D      Bm
Maybe Black Mesa.      That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance.
Em          A                        Bbmaj7
Anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist...

        F        C                    Bb         F
Look at me still talking when there's science to do,
       F        C                 Bb           F
When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you.
       Gm           C             F        (C)   Dm
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
       Bb         A          D    Bm
On the people who are still alive.
    D            Bm        D    Bm
And believe me I am still alive.
          D           Bm         D    Bm
I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
       D             Bm         D    Bm
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.
                 D          Bm        D    Bm
And while you're dying I'll be still alive.
                D           Bm        D    Bm        D    Bm        D(2)
And when you're dead I will be still alive.   Still alive.   Still alive.
