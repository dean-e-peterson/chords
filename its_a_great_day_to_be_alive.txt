      G
I got rice cooking in the microwave,
      D                       Em      C
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave,
          G     D           Em         C
And its a goofy thing but I just gotta say,
D       C       G
Hey I'm doing alright.

       G
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup,
D                      Em        C
Feelin pretty good and thats the truth,
     G       D         Em     C
It's neither drink nor drug induced,
D          C       G
No Im just doin' alright.


CHORUS:
D                         Em
And Its a great day to be alive,
           Am         Em             C        D
I know the suns still shinin' when I close my eyes.
             D/stop  D/stop           Em
There's some hard    times in the neigborhood,
    Am              Em     C         D
But why can't every day be just this good?


INSTRUMENTAL:  G  D  C  C

Its been 15 years since I left home,
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown,
Give it my best and then I left it alone,
Ohhh, I hope their doin' alright.

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me,
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be,
Lord, I guess he's doin alright.

CHORUS

BRIDGE #1:
Em            D                     C    G          Em      C    D
Sometimes its lonely, sometimes its only me and the shadows that fill.
     Em                  D                   C       G              Am   Em C  D
This room, sometimes I'm fallin' desperately callin' howlin' at the moon.
G
Ahhhwwoooooo!   Ahhhwooooooo!

       G
Well I might go get me a new tattoo,
   D                        Em        C
Or take my old harley for a three day cruise,
G          D         Em     C
Might even grow me a fu man chu, ohh, Aww!

CHORUS (x2)
