           G           D                 C                  Cm
This is my Earth and I live in it.  It's one third dirt and two thirds water,
       G                                     G7
And it rotates and revolves through space at rather an impressive pace,
    C          Cm           G
And never even messes up my hair.
    Emsus4            Em               Asus4         A
And here's the really weird thing, the force created by its spin
       C                    G              D
Is the force that stops the chaos flooding in.

           Emsus4 Em         C6  C       D                            B(7)     Em
This is my Earth,   and it's fine.  It's where I spend the vast majority of my time,
         Am    C           G               Am   C
It's not perfect, but it's mine.  It's not perfect.

           G             D                 C              Cm
This is my country and I live in it.  It's pretty big and nice to walk on,
        G                             G7
And the bloke who runs my country has built a demagoguery,
    C               Cm          G
And taught us to be fearful and boring.
        Emsus4            Em            Asus4        A
And the weirdest thing is that he is conservative of politics
    C             G          D
But really rather radical of eyebrow.

           Emsus4 Em         C6  C       D                            B(7)     Em
This is my country, and it's fine.  It's where I spend the vast majority of my time,
         Am    C           G               Am   C
It's not perfect, but it's mine.  It's not perfect.

           G           B(7)              C                  Cm
This is my house and I live in it.  It's made of cracks and photographs.
   G                               G7
We rent it off a guy who bought it from a guy,
                     C                 Cm          G
Who bought it from a guy whose grandad left it to him.
        Emsus4            Em                  Asus4             A
And the weirdest thing is that this house has locks to keep the baddies out,
            C              G              D
But they're mostly used to lock ourselves in.

           Emsus4 Em         C6  C       D                            B(7)     Em
This is my house,   and it's fine.  It's where I spend the vast majority of my time,
         Am    C           G               Am   C            G?     Bb?  F? G? F?
It's not perfect, but it's mine.  It's not perfect, but it's mine. (instrumental)

           G           D                 C      Cm
This is my body, and I live in it.  It's 31 and 6 months old.
     G                                         G7
It's changed a lot since it was new; it's done stuff it wasn't built to do,
  C            Cm              G
I often try to fill it up with wine.
        Emsus4          Em            Asus4              A
And the weirdest thing about it is, I spend so much time hating it
       C             G         D
But it never says a bad word about me.

           Emsus4 Em         C6  C       D                            B(7)     Em
This is my body,    and it's fine.  It's where I spend the vast majority of my time,
         Am    C           G               Am   C
It's not perfect, but it's mine.  It's not perfect.

           G            D                 C                Cm
This is my brain, and I live in it.  It's made of love and bad song lyrics.
     G                                 G7
It's tucked away behind my eyes, where all my screwed up thoughts can hide,
    C            Cm         G
Cos God forbid I hurt somebody.
        Emsus4                 Em            Asus4        A
And the weirdest thing about a mind, is that every answer that you find,
       C          G            D
Is the basis of a brand new cliché.

           Emsus4 Em         C6  C       D                            B(7)     Em
This is my brain,   and it's fine.  It's where I spend the vast majority of my time,
         Am    C           G               Am
It's not perfect, but it's mine.  It's not perfect,
    Em                                    Am
I'm not quite sure I've worked out how to work it.
         Am    C           G
It's not perfect, but it's mine.
