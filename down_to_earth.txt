Hi.
Here are a bunch of chords that might help you working on this tremandous song:
--
Intro:
Bb (with glitterings notes around) (x4)
Gm / Eb / Cm / Ab /Bb / Bb
Bb / C7 (x2)
Verse:
Bb / C7 (x4)
Gm / Eb / Bb / Eb / Bb / Bb (x2)
Chorus:
F / C / F /C / Bb / C / F / C (x2)
Bridge (Like a fish in the ocean):
Bb / C
--
You might adjust the number of bars, but this sounds great, unless my guitar was not correctly tuned (I just woke up and tried this quickly)
Enjoy, and feed back !
WooOOOAAAALLLLllleeeee.
Djeeloo.

P.S.: On the verse, the Bb and C7 goes Bb4 and C7/4, And the C is "7" in the Verse and plain in the chorus (and minor in the intro, but this is a typical P.G. weird trick...)

Er...
I misswrote:
The end of Chorus is not Bb/Bb but Bb/C7...
# Djeelooon Aug 28th 2008
I meant the end of the verse...
Feel free to tell me if you think I'm wrong on some points.

Somehow this almost worked:

especially if I changed  B C#  B C#  to  B C#7 C#7sus4 C#7  B C#7 C#7sus4 C#7...

When I looked up tabs for this song, I found that they were all horribly wrong!  I 
hope this is a little better.  Please leave constructive criticism in the comments 
as this is my first tab.
Verse 1:
          B              C#             B          C#
Did you think that your feet had been bound
           B       C#            B        C#
By what gravity brings to the ground?
         G#m            E
Did you feel you were tricked
         G#m        E
By the future you picked?
               B      C#     B     C#
Well, come on down
           G#m         E
All those rules don't apply
            G#m          E
When you're high in the sky
             B      C#
So, come on down
         B
Come on down
Chorus:
              F#           C#
We're coming down to the ground
             F#            C#
There's no better place to go
           F#             C#
We've got snow up on the mountains
           F#           C#
We've got rivers down below
              F#          C#
We're coming down to the ground
             F#                C#
We hear the birds sing in the trees
          F#               C#
And the land will be looked after
             F#               C#
We send the seeds out in the breeze
Verse 2:
B     C# x2
          B            C#           B        C#
Did you think you'd escaped from routine
    B            C#               B        C#
By changing the script and the scene?
G#m              E 
Despite all you made of it
        G#m      E   
You're always afraid
        B        C#     B      C#
Of the change
              G#m         E
You've got a lot on your chest
               G#m        E
Well, you can come as my guest
             B      C#
So come on down
          B  
Come on down
Chorus:
              F#           C#
We're coming down to the ground
             F#            C#
There's no better place to go
           F#             C#
We've got snow up on the mountains
           F#           C#
We've got rivers down below

Bridge:
                      B
Like the fish in the ocean
                        C#
We felt at home in the sea
                           B
We learned to live off the good land
[ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/p/peter-gabriel/212221.html ]
                       C#
Learned to climb up a tree
                       B
Then we got up on two legs
                C#
But we wanted to fly
                       B
When we messed up our homeland
                     C#
We set sail for the sky

We send the seeds out in the breeze
              F#        C#
We're coming down
                 F#       C#
Coming down to Earth
                F#       C#
Like babies at birth
                 F#       C#
Coming down to Earth
