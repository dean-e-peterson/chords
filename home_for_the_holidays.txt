Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays,

  Gm7 C7 F                               Dm7    G7      Cmaj7
I met a  man who lives in Tennessee, and he was headin' for
G7     C              Dm6      G7      C  C7
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie;
            F                                 Dm7     D7    C
From Pennsylvania folks are travelin' down to Dixie's sunny shore;
       G           Am     D7        G(7)    Gdim  Dm7
From Atlantic to Pacific - Gee, the traffic is terrific!


G7          C  C7         F    (F#dim) C
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays,
G7        C  (B7) (Bb7b5)  A7           D7 (D7b5) G7
'Cause no matter  how      far away you roam,
       C    C7    F     F#dim C          Am7
If you want to be happy in a  million ways,
F#dim   G7  Dm7      G          G7          C F C
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home.
