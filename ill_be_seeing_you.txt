Intro: D G D Bm Em7  A7

Dm                   Eb/G  A7                    Dm
Cathedral bells were tolling and our hearts sang on,
                    Eb/G A7            D
Was it the spell of Paris or the April dawn?
Abm7b5  C#7  C#+ C#7   F#m
Who knows if we  shall meet again?
    A/E      E7                  A      Em7/A  A7
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again:


D       F#7
I'll be seeing you
   Em      B7    Em
In all the old familiar places
          B7       Em     A7
That this heart of mine embraces
D
All day through:

Bm
In that small cafe,
    Em7
The park across the way,
    Em7/A  A   A7#5
The children's carousel,
    D
The chestnut trees,
    A9#5
The wishin' well.


D       F#7
I'll be seeing you
   Em    B7     Em
In every lovely summer's day,
  (Em)  B7           Em        A7
In everything that's light and gay.
     F#m7b5          B7
I'll always think of you that way.

     Em              F#7
I'll find you in the morning sun
    Bm                E9
And when the night is new.
        Em7
I'll be looking at the moon,
Em7b5       (A7)   D   F#m   Bm    (...repeat to that small cafe)
But I'll be seeing you.
                   D   Em7 (A7 A7#5) D  (...final time)
