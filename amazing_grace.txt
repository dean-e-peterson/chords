Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,
     G                   D   D7
     G       Em          Bm  D7/A
That saved a wretch like me!
  G        G7        C      G
  G        G7        C      G
I once was lost, but now am found,
    Em         G   D7 G  (C G)
D7  Em         Am  D7 G  (C G)
Was blind, but now I  see.

      G                 D7 Em    C  G
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    G        Em      Bm   D7/A
And grace my fears relieved;
    G        G7       C       G
How precious did that grace appear,
D7  Em     Am    D7 G    (C G)
The hour I first believed!

        G       D7    Em     C   G
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
  G      Em    Bm  D7/A
I have already come;
     G         G7         C         G
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
D7  Em         Am   D7 G  (C G)
And grace will lead me home.

    G           D7    Em   C  G
The Lord has promised good to me,
    G       Em     Bm  D7/A
His word my hope secures;
   G       G7         C       G
He will my shield and portion be,
D7 Em      Am   D7 G  (C G)
As long as life endures.

     G               D7  Em    C     G
Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
    G      Em         Bm  D7/A
And mortal life shall cease,
  G        G7        C      G
I shall possess, within the veil,
D7 Em      Am  D7  G   (C G)
A  life of joy and peace.

    G                D7 Em    C    G
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
    G      Em      Bm  D7/A
The sun forbear to shine;
    G        G7        C      G
But God, who called me here below,
D7   Em     Am D7 G  (C G)
Will be for-ev-er mine.

     G                D7  Em  C    G
When we've been there ten thousand years,
       G       Em     Bm  D7/A
Bright shining as the sun,
      G       G7      C          G
We've no less days to sing God's praise
D7   Em        Am    D7 G (C G)           Outro: G  Gmaj7   Em  Am7  D7  G  C  G
Than when we'd first begun.                        (320002)
