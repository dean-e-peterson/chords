        Cadd5           G              C
There's more that rises in the morning than the sun,
Em        Am                       Am7      F   Am  Dm
More that shines in the night than just the moon!
                            G              C     Em Am
There's more than just this fire here that keeps me warm,
     Dsus4           D                Gsus4  G
In a shelter that is larger than this room.
              C              G                C
And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiment,
      Em    Am                         Am7   F   Am  Dm
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing,
             G                      C Em Am
The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance
      Dsus4       D                 Gsus4  G
I owe only to the giver of all good things.


        C             F            Am           Dsus4    D       Gsus4 G Gsus4 G
So if I stand, let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through,
         Dm           F           Dm7              Gsus4   G     C F Em Am Gsus4
And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You!
    G    C           F            Am           Dsus4   D        Gsus4 G Gsus4 G
And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs,
         Dm          F       Dm7        Gsus4   G       C F Em Am Gsus4
But if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home.


        Cadd5            G                C
There's more that dances on the prarie(s) than the wind,
Em        Am                  Am7      F   Am  Dm
More that pulses in the ocean than the tide,
                       G                C    Em      Am
There's a love that is fiercer than the love between friends,
     Dsus4         D                  Gsus4         G
More gentle than a mother's, when her baby's at her side.
              C              G                C
And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiment,
      Em    Am                         Am7   F   Am  Dm
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing,
             G                      C Em Am
The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance
      Dsus4       D                 Gsus4  G
I owe only to the giver of all good things.


        C             F            Am           Dsus4    D       Gsus4 G Gsus4 G
So if I stand, let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through,
         Dm           F           Dm7              Gsus4   G     C F Em Am Gsus4
And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You!
    G    C           F            Am           Dsus4   D        Gsus4 G Gsus4 G
And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs,
         Dm          F       Dm7        Gsus4   G       C F Em Am Gsus4
But if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home.
         Dm          F       Dm7        Gsus4   G       Csus4 C Csus4 C
Yes if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home.
