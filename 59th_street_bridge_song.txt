D    A         E7       A
Slow down, you move too fast.

D          A        E7      A
You got to make the morning last.

D            A        E7     A
Just kicking down the cobble stones.

D           A       E7      A     D A Bm7 A
Looking for fun and Feelin' Groovy.


D     A        E7      A
Hello lampost, whatcha knowing?

D            A          E7      A
I've come to watch your flowers growing.

D        A      E7         A
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?

D        A        E7      A     D A Bm7 A
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' Groovy.


    D           A      E7          A
Got no deeds to do, no promises to keep.

    D           A          E7       A
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.

        D            A            E7        A
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me.

D       A         E7     A     D  A  Bm7  A  D  A  E7  A
Life, I love you, all is groovy.
