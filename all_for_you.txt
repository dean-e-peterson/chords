All for You
 - by Sister Hazel

Am        D                   Am               D
Finally I figured out, but it took a long long time,
Am                D          Am              D
And now there's a turnabout, maybe cause I'm trying.

Em           Am               Em            Am                  Em
There's been times, I'm so confused; all my roads, They lead to you;
             C               Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
I just can't turn, And walk away.

     G       C           Am   D      G
It's hard to say what it is I see in you,
       C       Am     D       G
Wonder if I'll always be with you,
     C          Am      D       G
But words can't say and I can't do
 C        Am          D       G C D G
Enough to prove, it's all for you.


Am            D                        Am               D
I thought I'd seen it all, 'cause it's been a long long time,
Am             D              Am               D
But then we'll trip and fall, wondering if I'm blind.

Em           Am               Em            Am                  Em
There's been times, I'm so confused; all my roads, They lead to you;
             C               Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
I just can't turn, And walk away.

     G       C           Am   D      G
It's hard to say what it is I see in you,
       C       Am     D       G
Wonder if I'll always be with you,
     C          Am      D       G
But words can't say and I can't do
 C        Am          D       G C D G
Enough to prove, it's all for you.


Em         Am                    Em
Rain comes pouring down (Pouring down)
        Am                                 Em
Falling from blue skies (Falling from blue skies)
          C (or Am?)   Am7              Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
Words without a sound, coming from your eyes.


     G       C           Am   D      G
It's hard to say what it is I see in you,
       C       Am     D       G
Wonder if I'll always be with you,
     C          Am      D       G
But words can't say and I can't do
 C        Am          D       G C D G
Enough to prove, it's all for you.
