   C         D
If these old walls,
   C         D           G
If these old walls could speak
   C           G      D      Em
Of things that they remember well,
D           G     D      C
Stories and faces dearly held,
  C         D           G       C
A couple in love livin' week to week,
              G
Rooms full of laughter,
C                    D
If these walls could speak.

   C         D
If these old halls,
   C        D           G
If hallowed halls could talk,
C           G      D       Em
These would have a tale to tell
   D         G        D      C
Of sun goin' down and dinner bell,
    C        D          G        C
And children playing at hide and seek
              G
From floor to rafter,
C                    D
If these halls could speak.

C                  D         G   D
They would tell you that I'm sorry
C                  D         G   D
For bein' cold and blind and weak.
Am or C             Bm or D   G or Em
They would tell you that it's only
              D        C
That I have a stubborn streak,
C                    D or G
If these walls could speak.


   C         D
If these old fashioned
C      D          G
Window panes were eyes,
  C          G          D       Em
I guess they would have seen it all -
D           G        D        C
Each little tear and sigh and footfall,
    C     D             G       C
And every dream that we came to seek
            G
Or followed after,
C                    D
If these walls could speak.

C                  D       G   D
They would tell you that I owe you
C                 D    G  D
More than I could ever pay.
Am or C            Bm or D  G or Em
Here's someone who really   loves you;
           D   C
Don't ever go away.
                              D or G
That's what these walls would say.  (repeat last stanza, then last line twice)
