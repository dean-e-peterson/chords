D         C#m7    F#7                Bm    Bm/A  G
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
       A7                      G/D  D
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
A/C# Bm  E7       G  D
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


D        C#m7     F#7            Bm       Bm/A  G
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
          A7             G/D  D
There's a shadow hanging o -  ver me,
A/C# Bm    E7       G  D
Oh,  yesterday came suddenly.


    (Chorus)
    C#m(7)F#7 Bm  A  G(maj7)     Em        A7       D
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    E/F# F#7  Bm  A     G(maj7)      Em       A     D
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


D         C#m7      F#7          Bm       Bm/A  G
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      A7              G/D  D
Now I need a place to hide away,
A/C# Bm  E7       G  D
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


    (Chorus)
    C#m(7)F#7 Bm  A  G(maj7)     Em        A7       D
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    E/F# F#7  Bm  A     G(maj7)      Em       A     D
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


D         C#m7      F#7          Bm        Bm/A  G
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      A7              G/D  D
Now I need a place to hide away,
A/C# Bm  E7       G  D         D/A   E/G#  G  D
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.   Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm-mm-mmm.
