Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
       C7                      Bb/F F
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
C/E  Dm  G7       Bb F
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


F        Em7      A7             Dm       Dm/C  Bb
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
          C7             Bb/F F
There's a shadow hanging o -  ver me,
C/E  Dm    G7       Bb F
Oh,  yesterday came suddenly.


    (Chorus)
    Em(7) A7  Dm  C  Bb(maj7)    Gm        C7       F
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    G/A  A7   Dm  C     Bb(maj7)     Gm       C     F
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


F         Em7       A7           Dm       Dm/C  Bb
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      C7              Bb/F F
Now I need a place to hide away,
C/E  Dm  G7       Bb F
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


    (Chorus)
    Em(7) A7  Dm  C  Bb(maj7)    Gm        C7       F
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    G/A  A7   Dm  C     Bb(maj7)     Gm       C     F
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


F         Em7       A7           Dm        Dm/C  Bb
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      C7              Bb/F F
Now I need a place to hide away,
C/E  Dm  G7       Bb F         F/C   G/B   Bb F
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.   Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm-mm-mmm.
