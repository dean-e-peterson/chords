Em         G            D/F#    Em                        B7 Em
I've got a mule and her name is Sal, 15 miles on the Erie Ca-nal.
Em               G            D/F#     Em                        B7 Em
She's a good old worker and a good old pal, 15 miles on the Erie Ca-nal.
      G                         D    Em                            B
We've hauled some barges in our day, filled with lumber, coal, and hay,
    Em      G     D/F#        Em                         D
And we know every inch of the way from Albany to Buffalo.

   G                     D     G                     (C)    D    G
   Low bridge, everybody down. Low bridge, for we're coming to a town.
   G                           C (or D?)            G                C (or D?)
   And you'll always know your neighbor, and you'll always know your pal,
             G        C            G    D G
   If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal.

Em                G           D/F#    Em                        B7 Em
We'd better look 'round for a job old gal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal.
Em                  G              D/F#      Em                        B7 Em
'Cause you bet your life I'd never part with Sal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal.
    G                               D      Em                          B
Git up there gal, we've passed that lock.  We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock.
   Em       G        D/F#       Em                             D
So one more trip and back we'll go, right back home to Buffalo.

   G                     D     G                        (C)    D       G
   Low bridge, everybody down. Low bridge, I've got the finest mule in town.
   G                       C (or D?)       G           C (or D?)
   Once a man named Mike McGinty, tried to put it over Sal,
             G               C             G    D G
   Now he's 'way down at the bottom of the Erie Canal.

Em                G       D/F#    Em                         B7 Em
Oh, where would I be if I lost my pal?  15 miles on the Erie Canal.
Em              G             D/F#    Em                        B7 Em
Oh, I'd like to see a mule as good as Sal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal.
  G                           D     Em                    B
A friend of mine once got her sore, now he's got a busted jaw,
       Em      G            D/F# Em                                D
'Cause she let fly with her iron toe, and kicked him in to Buffalo.

   G                     D     G                     (C)    D    G
   Low bridge, everybody down. Low bridge, for we're coming to a town.
   G                           C (or D?)            G                C (or D?)
   And you'll always know your neighbor, and you'll always know your pal,
             G        C            G    D G
   If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal.

Em            G           D/F#    Em                        B7 Em
Don't have to call when I want my Sal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal.
Em                 G            D/F#     Em                        B7 Em
She trots from her stall like a good old gal, 15 miles on the Erie Canal.
  G                          D    Em                      B
I eat my meals with Sal each day, I eat beef and she eats hay,
        Em       G           D/F#    Em                                  D
And she ain't so slow if you want to know, she put the "Buff" in Buffalo.

   G                     D     G                     (C)    D    G
   Low bridge, everybody down. Low bridge, for we're coming to a town.
   G                           C (or D?)            G                C (or D?)
   And you'll always know your neighbor, and you'll always know your pal,
             G        C            G    D G
   If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal.
