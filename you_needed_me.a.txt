D#dim   (xx1212) or (234242)

E7        A                  D
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry,
         E7                     A
I was confused, you cleared my mind,
             A7               D
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me,
            B7              E
And held me up, and gave me dignity,
            E7
Somehow you needed me.

(E7)        A                  D
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            E7               A
To face the world, out on my own again.
              A7       D      D#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   A                C#7     F#m  B7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    E7             A           C#7
You needed me, you needed me.

    (C#7)  F#m                  A
    And I can't believe it's you,
                D            A
    I can't believe it's true.
      Bm7       E7            A     C#7
    I needed you and you were there.
             F#m                A                   D        A
    And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
                B7                                E7
    'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares.

(E7)        A                D
You held my hand when it was cold.
           E7               A
When I was lost you took me home
               A7           D
You gave me hope when I was at the end,
              B7             E
And turned my lies back into truth again,
         E7
You even called me "friend".

(E7)        A                  D
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            E7               A
To face the world, out on my own again.
              A7       D      D#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   A                C#7     F#m  B7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    E7             A        F#7
You needed me, you needed me.
    B7      E7     A        F#7  Bm7  E7sus4  E7  A
You needed me, you needed me.
