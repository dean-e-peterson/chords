Haul out the holly;
           G    G6 Gmaj7 G6 Dm6        E7     E7-9
Put up the tree be-fore  my     spirit falls again.
Am7  D7     Am   Am7 D7
Fill up the stocking,
         Am7     Am7-5      D7                     Dm6 E7
I may be rushing things, but  deck the halls again now.
Am6 E7 Am            D7         G          Gmaj7 G6     G+
For we need a little Christmas, Right this very  minute,
Am             D7      G      Gmaj7  G6
Candles in the window, Carols at the spinet.
G7      C             D7         G          Gmaj7 G6
Yes, we need a little Christmas, Right this very  minute.
   A7                                 D7
It hasn't snowed a single flurry, but Santa, dear, we're in a hurry;
   G     G6       Gmaj7   G6
So climb down the chimney;
           G     G6  Gmaj7  G6 Dm6             E7   E7-9
Put up the brightest string of     lights I've ever seen.
Am7   D7     Am   Am7 D7
Slice up the fruitcake;
             Am7       Am7-5  D7                  Dm6 E7
It's time we hung some tinsel    on the evergreen bough.
Am6 E7   Am             D7      G       Gmaj7  G6     G+
For I've grown a little leaner, Grown a little colder,
Am             D7      G       Gmaj7  G6
Grown a little sadder, Grown a little older,
G7    C             D7     G       Gmaj7 G6
And I need a little angel, sitting on my shoulder,
Am            D9    D7  G
Need a little Christmas now.
