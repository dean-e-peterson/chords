Intro:  C  G7  F  C

      C          G              Am          F
Small craft in a harbour that's still and serene,
     C      G           C7              F
Give no indication what their ways have been;
     C             G            Am         F
They rock at their moorings all nestled in dreams,
 C            G7          F  C
Away from the roll of the sea.

      C               G          Am      F
Their stern lines are groaning a lullaby air,
  C            G        C7          F
A ghost in the cuddy, a gull on the spar;
    C          G          Am        F
But never they whisper of journeys afar,
 C            G7          F  C
Away from the roll of the sea.


REFRAIN:
    C            C/G            C   C/G
Oh, had they the tongues for to speak,
     A7                        Dm
What tales of adventure they'd weave;
    Dm           C6          C
But now they are anchored to sleep,
    C6        G      G7     G6     Gadd5
And slumber a-lee (a-lee, a-lee, a-lee).


     C             G           Am         F
Come fair winds to wake them tomorrow, we pray,
     C         G         C7         F
Come harvest a-plenty to them ev'ry day;
     C         G              Am              F
Till guided by harbour lights they're home to stay,
 C            G7          F  C
Away from the roll of the sea.


(Repeat from refrain through end)

 C            G7          F  C
Away from the roll of the sea.   (2x at end)
