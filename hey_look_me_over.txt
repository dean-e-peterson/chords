G                  B7   F#m7  Ddim  B7
Hey, look me over, lend me an ear;
E7                   Am
Fresh out of clover, mortgaged up to here.
    D7    Am7      D7           G     B7       E7
But don't pass the plate folks, don't pass the cup;
  A7                                       D7
I figure whenever you're down and out, the only way is up.

            G                 B7   F#m7   Ddim  B7
And I'll be up like a rosebud high on the vine;
E7                          Am
Don't thumb your nose, bud, take a tip from mine.
      Cmaj7                   F9             G             E7
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some,
         Am7        D7     G
And look out world, here I come.


(Repeat from start)

G
Nobody in the world was ever without a prayer;
F
How can you win the world, if nobody knows you're there?
E
Kid, when you need the crowd, the tickets are hard to sell;
D7sus4                                                 D7
Still you can lead the crowd, if you can get up and yell:


G                  B7   F#m7  Ddim  B7
Hey, look me over, lend me an ear;
E7                   Am
Fresh out of clover, mortgaged up to here.

(skip?)     D7    Am7      D7           G     B7       E7
        But don't pass the plate folks, don't pass the cup;
          A7                                       D7
        I figure whenever you're down and out, the only way is up.

                    G                 B7   F#m7   Ddim  B7
        And I'll be up like a rosebud high on the vine;
        E7                          Am
        Don't thumb your nose, bud, take a tip from mine.

      Cmaj7                   F9             G             E7
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some,
         Am7                A#dim (or A7?)
And look out world, here me shout world,
         Am7        D7     G    (D G)
And look out world, here I come.
