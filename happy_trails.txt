(verse from Nickel Creek lyrics, but perhaps part of full original lyrics?)
Some trails are happy ones.
Others are blue.
It's the way you ride the trail that counts,
Here's a happy one for you.

      E                       Fdim  B7
Happy trails to you, until we meet again.
      B7sus4    B7                B(7)+ E
Happy trails to you, keep smiling until then.
    E7                                A
Who cares about the clouds if we're together?
     C#7                             F#9 B7
Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather.
      E         C#7          F#m  B7 E
Happy trails to you, 'til we meet again.

E                C#7   F#m
Some trails are happy, others are blue.
         B7
It's the way you ride the trail that counts,
                       E
Here's a happy one for you.

      E                       Fdim  B7
Happy trails to you, until we meet again.
      B7sus4    B7                B(7)+ E
Happy trails to you, keep smiling until then.
    E7                                A
Who cares about the clouds if we're together?
     C#7                             F#9 B7
Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather.

Happy trails to you, 'til we meet again.
