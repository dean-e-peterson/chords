A                          D                   A
Robin Hood and Little John walkin' through the forest,
                                    E                A
Laughin' back and forth at what the other one has to say.
                               D             A
Reminiscin', This-'n'-that an' havin' such a good time,
                          E             A
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally, Golly, what a day.

A7
Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water,
          D
They were drinkin', they just guzzled it down.
B7
Never dreamin' that a schemin' sherrif and his posse
      E
Was a-watchin' them an' gatherin' around.


A                          D                   A
Robin Hood and Little John runnin' through the forest,
                                  E              A
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees an' tryin' to get away.
                            D                A
Contemplatin' nothin' but escape an' fin'lly makin' it,
                          E             A
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally, Golly, what a day.
             B7           D7     E7     A7
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally, Golly, what a day.
