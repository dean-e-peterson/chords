Intro: B7  E  A  E  B7

     Em                         Am                B7
When you attend a funeral it is sad to think that sooner or later
Em                  C7              B7
Those you love will do the same for you.
        Em                                 Am            B7
And you may have thought it tragic, not to mention other adjec-
          Em               C       (F#7)     B7
Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do.  But don't you worry.

        Em                               F
No more ashes, no more sackcloth, and an armband made of black cloth
     B                          E
Will someday never more adorn a sleeve.
                              E7            A                     F#7
For if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too
            B7                    E          
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve, and...


A       E                       A                                        B7
We will all go together when we go, what a comforting thought that is to know.
   E                        A        (F#m)                    B7                      E  C7
Universal bereavement, an inspiring achievement, yes, we will all go together when we go.


        F                       Bb                       (Gm)         C(7)
We will all go together when we go, all suffused with an incandescent glow.
            F          (F7)          Bb            (Gm)
No one will have the endurance to collect on his insurance
           C                               F  (C#7)
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go.


           F#                       E                                          Eb  D  Eb
Oh we will all fry together when we fry. We'll be french fried potatoes by and by.
                                      E
There will be no more misery when the world is our rotisserie,
             Bb                       Eb
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry.
                F7  Bb7                        G7         Cm  B7
Down by the old maelstrom, there'll be a storm before the calm,


            E                         A                                       B7
And we will all bake together when we bake, there'll be nobody present at the wake.
     E                              A            (F#m)
With complete participation in that grand incineration
       B7                               E  C7
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak.


           F                         Bb                        (Gm)           C7
Oh we will all char together when we char, and let there be no moaning of the bar.
          F        (F7)          Bb         (Gm)        C(7)                       F  (C#7)
Just sing out a Te Deum when you see that ICBM, and the party will be "come as you are".


           F#                        E                                                Eb D Eb
Oh we will all burn together when we burn, there'll be no need to stand and wait your turn.
Eb                                        E
When it's time for the fallout, and Saint Peter calls us all out
           Bb                     Eb
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn.


G#m                                         C#7
You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas,
F#m                                                     B7
Go directly, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dollahs.


            E                       A                       (F#m)     B7
And we will all go together when we go, ev'ry Hottentot and ev'ry Eskimo.
         E            E7               A           F#(m)
When the air becomes uranious, we will all go simultaneous.
       B(7)                          C#(7)                    F#(m)         B7             E
Yes we all will go together, when we all go together, Yes, we all will go together when we go.
