G      D   Cadd9                  G              D               Cadd9
4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, somewhere in Kenya that I can't pronounce,
     G                    D               Cadd9
They found a thing that's ape-like in its parallel tooth row
    G                 D          Cadd9
But human-like in its postcranial morphology.
    G                D         Cadd9                       G              D             Cadd9
Oh, Australopithecus anamensis, how I wanna be friends-is, but you're too primitive for me.
G                D         Cadd9                           G            D          Cadd9
Australopithecus anamensis, you're just too darn ape-like, in your cranial morphology.
            D                            Cadd9                      G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9
Because you may have been bipedal, let's walk on to the next one now.


G      D   Cadd9                  G   D             Cadd9
4.2 to 3.0 million years ago, Ethiopia and Tanzania too
     G            D            Cadd9
Many ape-like and hominin-like specimens were found
              G               D                         Cadd9
But were they really just one species, or could they be two?
    G                D         Cadd9                      G       D              Cadd9
Oh, Australopithecus afarensis, How I wanna be friend-is, but you really need to choose.
G                D         Cadd9                              G       D           Cadd9
Australopithecus afarensis, are you just a sexually dimorphic species, or are you two?
     D                          Cadd9                   G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9
Make up your darn mind, while I move to the next one now.


G      D   Cadd9                       G              D                Cadd9
3.0 to 2.3 million years ago, found in various sites across South Africa
          G                  D   Cadd9                    G                D     Cadd9
While our brain size now is 1400 cubic centimetres, these guys got by with only 458.
G                D         Cadd9                              G       D                     Cadd9
Australopithecus africanus, no offense to you and your genus, but you must have been pretty dumb.
G                D         Cadd9                            G             D                     Cadd9
Australopithecus africanus, your only redeeming feature is, South African accents can be pretty hot.
   D                                        Cadd9                      G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9
So bring your sexy accent with you, when we move on to the next one now.


G      D   Cadd9                 G             D               Cadd9
2.7 to 2.3 million years ago, in West Turkana, Kenya they were found,
      G            D                Cadd9                G                  D          Cadd9
Large faces, large skull crests, and enormous teeth, a remarkably primitive hominin by now.
G                D           Cadd9                    G           D          Cadd9
Australopithecus aethiopicus, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing your name right.
G                D           Cadd9                                  G     D         Cadd9
Australopithecus aethiopicus, why didn't you bother developing, like everybody else did?
D                                 Cadd9                        G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9
You're too lazy to evolve, so I'm moving on to the next one now.


G      D   Cadd9                 G       D   Cadd9
2.2 to 1.2 million years ago, in Olduvai, Tanzania,
G                  D             Cadd9              G           D                  Cadd9
People found some 'hyper-robust' hominins that were contemporaneous with the genus Homo.
    G               D       Cadd9
Oh, Australopithecus boisei, go find someone your own size,
     G           D                       Cadd9
Like Aethiopicus, who your morphology is similar to.
G                D      Cadd9                               G         D               Cadd9
Australopithecus boisei, you're just not that important, so I'm gonna have to say buh-bye.
        D                                       Cadd9                           G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9
I don't really know much about boisei, so let's quickly move to the last one now.


G                  D       Cadd9                      G             D            Cadd9
Somewhere in South Africa, 1 or 2 million years ago, another robust form was dug up.
      G              D         Cadd9                       G            D        Cadd9
Their small anterior teeth and large posterior teeth, were covered in a thick enamel.
    G                D        Cadd9
Oh, Australopithecus robustus, Oh, you're nothing like us,
       G          D                      Cadd9
But you must have had some really strong teeth.
G                D        Cadd9                          G     D                   Cadd9
Australopithecus robustus, I don't wanna make a fuss, but I'm afraid you might eat me.
     D                         Cadd9
Your teeth are kinda scary, so now I'll run away,
         D                                 Cadd9           G D Cadd9  G D Cadd9  G
But I'll run right to the term test, which now I won't fail.
