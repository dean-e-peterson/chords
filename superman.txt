C                 G
I can't stand to fly;
Am             F
I'm not that naive.
C                G
I'm just out to find
    Am              F
The better part of me.
                 C                       G
I'm more than a bird...I'm more that a plane,
               Am            F
More than some pretty face beside a train.
         C       G  F  G  C
It's not easy to be me.

C                  G
Wish that I could cry,
Am           F
Fall upon my knees,
C              G
Find a way to lie
        Am              F
About a home I'll never see.
               C                     G
It may sound absurd...but don't be naive,
     Am              F
Even heroes have the right to bleed.
            C                         G
I may be disturbed...but won't you concede,
     Am              F
Even heroes have the right to dream.
         C       G  F  G
It's not easy to be me.

Am     G C      F        Am
Up, up ahead...away from me,
         D               Am                D
It's all right...you can all sleep sound tonight.
        F (Fm7dim5? F)            G (Gsus4 Gadd5)
I'm not crazy...        or anything...

C                 G
I can't stand to fly;
Am             F
I'm not that naive.
C                    G
Men weren't meant to ride
     Am                   F
With clouds between their knees.
           C                  G
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet,
            Am                 F
Digging for kryptonite on this one-way street;
       C                  G
Only a man in a funny red sheet,
            Am               F
Looking for special things inside of me,
          C G            Am F           C G            Am F
Inside of me...inside of me...inside of me...inside of me.
         C       G  F
It's not easy to be me.
