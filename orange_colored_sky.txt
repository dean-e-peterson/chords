      A        F#7   D          Ebdim
I was walking along, minding my business,

A              F#m7           F#7
When out of an orange-colored sky,
D       Cdim  A    F#7   D         E7       A   E7
Flash!  Bam!  Alakazam!  Wonderful you came by.

      A         F#7   D           Ebdim
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,

A                F#m7           F#7
When out of that orange-colored view,
D      Cdim   A    F#7   D       E7      A
Wham!  Bam!   Alakazam!  I got a look at you.

(Bridge)
D6                     Cdim    A             C#7    F#m
One look and I yelled "Timber! Watch out for flying glass!"
          (B7                      F#m)
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out,
      (B7                 F#m)
I went into a spin, and I started to shout,
           E7           Bm7/5-        E7
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I - T, it!"

      A        F#7   D          Ebdim
I was walking along, minding my business,

A                  F#m7          F#7
When love came and hit me in the eye.
D       Cdim  A    F#7             D(maj7)
Flash!  Bam!  Alakazam!  Out of an orange-colored,
Dm7?            Bm7(-5)                (B7)
Purple striped, pretty green polka dot sky,
D?          Bm7? (E7?)           A    (A6?)
Flash, bam, alacazaaam, and good bye.

(Spoken: Wow! I thought that love was much softer than that,
         what a most disturbing sound.)

I always thought it was a maj7#5.. actually,
I guess it's the exact same thing though (as a min-maj9)
