     G    Gdim G            C   Cdim   C
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
A   D         D7            G
The emblem of suffering and shame;
      G        Gdim G               C      Cdim C
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
A     D             D7          G
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

CHORUS:
        D           D7         G    (Gdim  Gsus4  G)
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
        C                      G
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
                    G7         C    (Am7)
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    G                D7        G    (C G)
And exchange it some day for a crown.


       G   Gdim   G           C      Cdim   C
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
A     D          D7           G
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
        G    Gdim    G            C   Cdim C
For the dear lamb of God left His glory  a-bove,
A  D          D7        G
To bear it on dark Calvary.

CHORUS:
        D           D7         G    (Gdim  Gsus4  G)
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
        C                      G
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
                    G7         C    (Am7)
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    G                D7        G    (C G)
And exchange it some day for a crown.


       G   Gdim   G                   C     Cdim C
In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A D        D7       G
A wondrous beauty I see;
          G      Gdim G           C       Cdim C
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
A  D          D7       G
To pardon and sanctify me.

CHORUS:
        D           D7         G    (Gdim  Gsus4  G)
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
        C                      G
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
                    G7         C    (Am7)
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    G                D7        G    (C G)
And exchange it some day for a crown.


       G   Gdim   G            C  Cdim C
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
A   D           D7            G
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
           G       Gdim G          C      Cdim C
Then He'll call me some-day to His home far  a-way,
A         D        D7        G
Where His glory forever I'll share.

CHORUS:
        D           D7         G    (Gdim  Gsus4  G)
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
        C                      G
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
                    G7         C    (Am7)
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    G                D7        G    (C G)
And exchange it some day for a crown.
