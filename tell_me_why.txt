Tell Me Why (the Stars Do Shine)

D (Dmaj7 D7) G       C        G
Tell     me  why the stars do shine,
D (Dsus2 D)  G       A7  D7
Tell     me  why the ivy twines,
D (Dmaj7 D7) G       C        B(7)
Tell     me  why the sky's so blue,
E7         A7            D7         G
And I will tell you just why I love you.

D (Dmaj7 D7) G        C        G
Because  God made the stars to shine,
D (Dsus2 D)  G        A7  D7
Because  God made the ivy twine,
D (Dmaj7 D7) G        C      B(7)
Because  God made the sky so blue,
E7          A7              D7         G
Because God made you that's why I love you.

D (Dmaj7 D7) G               C    G
I   really   think that dear God above,
D (Dsus2 D)  G            A7    D7
Created      you just for me to love,
D  (Dmaj7 D7) G        C       B(7)
He picked you out from all the rest,
E7         A7            D7           G
Because he knew that I'd love you the best.

(Some Garrison Keillor A Prairie Home Companion show lyrics...)

D (Dmaj7 D7) G         C      G
In  the  e - vent of a sudden loss,
D (Dsus2 D) G            A7     D7
Of cab - in pressure the panel above,
D   (Dmaj7 D7)  G   C         B(7)
Your heads will automatically open,
E7             A7         D7            G
Grasp the mask firmly and breath naturally.

D (Dmaj7 D7) G       C      G
I pledge al-legience to the flag,
D (Dsus2 D) G          A7       D7
Of the   re-public for which it stands,
D  (Dmaj7 D7) G   C   B(7)
One na - tion indivisible (under God),
E7        A7     D7          G
With liberty and justice for all.
