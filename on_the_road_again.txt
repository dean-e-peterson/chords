On the Road again
 - by Willie Nelson
 - actually in E?


       C
On the road again, 
                                  E7
Just can't get wait to get on the road again.
                          Dm
The life I love is makin' music with my friends,
    F                   G7           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again.       


       C
On the road again,
                       E7
Goin' places that I've never been,
                         Dm
Seein' things that I may never see again,
    F                   G7           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again.


       F
On the road again, 
                                      C
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway.
          F
We're the best of friends, 
                                      C
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way,
    G7
And our way,


          C
Is on the road again.
                              E7
Just can't wait to get on the road again.
                          Dm
The life I love is makin' music with my friends,
    F                   G7           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again.
    F                   G7           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again.
