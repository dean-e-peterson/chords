C                                          G
In a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine,
        F            C              (Dm7)     G7    C
Lived a miner, forty-niner, and his daughter, Clementine.

REFRAIN:
C                                                    G
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling Clementine,
        F                C              (Dm7)  G7    C
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine.

Light she was and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine,
Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine.


Drove she ducklings to the water, every morning just at nine,
Hit her foot against a splinter, fell into the foaming brine.


Ruby lips above the water, blowing bubbles soft and fine,
But alas, I was no swimmer, so I lost my Clementine.

(Refrain)

Then the miner, forty-niner, soon began to peak and pine
Thought he oughta join his daughter, now he's with his Clementine.


There's a churchyard on the hillside, where the flowers grow and twine,
There grow roses, 'mongst the posies, fertilized by Clementine.


In my dreams she still doth haunt me, robed in garlands soaked in brine,
Though in life I used to hug her, now she's dead, I draw the line.

(Refrain)

Now you scouts may learn the moral, of this little tale of mine,
Artificial respiration, would have saved my Clementine.


How I missed her, how I missed her, how I missed my Clementine,
Till I kissed her little sister, and forgot my Clementine.
