Manly Man
- by Elle Cordova (aka Reina del Cid)
- originally in F


            C                 F          C
Well, there once was a man, a very manly man,

                                   G
Accessorized right o'er his eyes a manly black bandan,

   C                            F 
To see no queer, hear no queer, genderqueer or trans,

            C      G     C
'cause he's such a Manly Man.



    C                             F                  C
For Superman it's kryptonite that took his strength away.

                              G
For Manly Man it's pronouns because they make him gay.

        C                             F
All you have to do is ask him if he's he or she or they,

     C        G     C
To defeat the Manly Man.
