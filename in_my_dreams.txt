In My Dreams
 - REO Speedwagon (songwriters Kevin Cronin and Tom Kelly)

G                     D
There was a time some time ago
     G             D       Em    C               G    
When every sunrise meant a sunny day, oh a sunny day
    G                    D
But now when the morning light shines in
   G                 D         Em      C               D
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay, oh where I lay
C                   D
I used to thank the lord when I'd wake
    C                                 D       (Dsus4 D Dsus2 D)
For life and love and the golden sky above me
    D              Em               C                                 G
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin', you see in my dreams you love me 

G             D
Daybreak is a joyful time
     G             D        Em   C                 G
Just listen to the songbird harmonies, oh the harmonies
    G                     D
But I wish the dawn would never come
G                D       Em     C             D
I wish there was silence in the trees, oh the trees
   C            D               C                                     D
If only I could stay asleep, at least I could pretend you're thinkin' of me
       D                Em            C                   
'Cause nighttime is the one time I am happy, you see in my dreams 

Chorus:
D  G         C         D             Em
We climb and climb and at the top we fly
        C        G            Am             D
Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
      Em         C              G
And I don't know really what it means
      D                C              G
All I know is that you love me, in my dreams 

(Solo) 

C                           G          C                             G
I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken, and somehow she'll be lying by my side
         F(?)          Dm(?)          Em
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'
    C                            Dsus4 D
She touches me and suddenly I'm alive 

Chorus (repeats 2x?):
D  G         C         D             Em
We climb and climb and at the top we fly
        C        G            Am             D
Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
      Em         C              G
And I don't know really what it means
      D                C              G Am D  G D Em   C D   G
All I know is that you love me, in my dreams, on   -ly in my dreams.
