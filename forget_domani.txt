A             F#7    Bm                    Cdim    A
Let's forget about tomorrow,  let's forget about tomorrow
A             F#7    Bm     Dm6   A      E7    A
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

Dm7  Am    Fdim          Am   Fdim
Do - mani,      forget domani
      (E7)     Am      AmM7  Am7     Am6     Dm
Let's live for now and any - how who needs domani?
    E7               Dm6       E7
The moonlight, let's share the moonlight
   Dm6    E              E7        Am   Fdim
Perhaps together we will never be again

E7      Am   Dm7  E7      Am   Dm7
Ah, che luna,     oh, che mare
     E7     Am       AmM7   Am7     Am6     Dm
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
         Dm    DmM7         Dm7     Dm6
I get so dizzy when you're standing near
     Am      AmM7  Am7      Am6
It's not the music that you hear
Dm(7)              E7             Am
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
      A7       Dm      DmM7    Dm7    Dm6
Let's take the minutes as they speed away
    Am        AmM7      Am7    Am6
And hope it's true what people say
      Fdim              E7           A      D  E
"When you're in love, tomorrow never comes"

Final Refrain: (2x)
A             F#7    Bm                    Cdim    A
Let's forget about tomorrow,  let's forget about tomorrow
A             F#7    Bm     Dm6   A      E(7)  A
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes.
