C           F    C    G    C  G E  E/G# Am   E7       Am
Many is the time I've been mistaken and many times confused.
C             F C   G    C  G C   E   Am     E     Am   (C9) C7
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused.
        F     G          F C               F  C  G  G#dim  Am    A7
Oh, but I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm just weary to my     bones.
D7         G                  C      G   D     G
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant.
C  F   C G       E E/G# Am Dm C/G  G7       C
So far away from home,     so far away from home.

C              F    C     G   C    G  E
I don't know a soul who's not been battered,
  E/G#         Am         E7            Am
I don't know a friend who feels that at ease.
C              F     C      G   C    G   C     E  Am     E7     Am   (C9) C7
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees.
        F      G           F C             F     C  G    G#dim Am   A7
Oh, but it's alright, it's alright; for we lived so well so    long.
D7     G                   C    G    D         G
Still, when I think of the road were traveling on
C F  C   G           E E/G# Am Dm?              C/G     G7          C
I wonder what's gone wrong.    I can't help but wonder, what's gone wrong.

C
And I dreamed I was dying.
C                 G    (G#dim)  Am
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly,
F#dim            G/D         F          C     G
And looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly.
G                   C
And I dreamed I was flying.
             G        (G#dim)    Am
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see
F#dim         G/D     F        C      G
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea.
                    C
And I dreamed I was flying.

C              F    C    G    C   G  E
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower.
   E/G#        Am        E7         Am
We come on the ship that sailed the moon.
   C           F     C      G  C    G  C  E   Am      E        Am  (C9) C7
We come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an American tune.
        F      G           F               C                F  C  G  G#dim Am A7
Oh, and it's alright, it's alright, it's alright. You can't be forever blessed.
D7     G                   C  G    D       G
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day

C       F      C  G        E  E/G#  Am
And I'm trying to get some rest.
       Dm      C/G  G7             C      F    C    G    C    G    G7   C
That's all I'm trying, to get some rest.
