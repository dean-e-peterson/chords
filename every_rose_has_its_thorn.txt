Intro:  G  Cadd9  G  Cadd9

G                                  Cadd9
We both lie silently still, in the dead of the night.
            G                                Cadd9
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside.
       G                    C
Was it something I said, or something I did,
       G                          C
Did my words not come (turn?) out right?
         D
Though I tried not to hurt you,
         C
Though I tried, but I guess that's why they say:

CHORUS:
G                  Cadd9             G                   Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn.  Just like every night has its dawn.
          G     D              C        G                        C
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song. Every rose has its thorn.

G                              Cadd9
I listen to our favorite song, playing on a radio.
         G                                     Cadd9
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go.
      G            C               G              C
But I wonder, does he know, has he ever felt like this?
         D
And I know that you'd be here, right now.
    C
If I coulda let you know somehow, I guess...

CHORUS:

BRIDGE:
Em                D                C                  G    (D)
Though it's been awhile now, I can still feel so much pain.
Em                D                        C                          G
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains.

Instrumental: (guitar solo and...)   G  Cadd9  G  Cadd9

  G                                             Cadd9
I know I coulda saved our love that night if I'd known what to say.
G                             Cadd9
Instead of making love we both made our separate ways.
          G                     C                 G                C
And now I hear you've found somebody new & that I never meant that much to you.
   D
To hear that tears me up inside,
      C
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess...

(CHORUS)
