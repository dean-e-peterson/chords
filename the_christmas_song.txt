Chestnuts roasting on an open fire;

Cmaj7      Gm7     C7      Fmaj7  Bb9
Jack Frost nipping at your nose;

Am       Bb9          C         (F#m7)  B
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir,

    E(maj7)       Fm7     (Bb9) Ebmaj7
And folks dressed up like Es-ki-mos.



Dm7  G7   C       Dm6             Em      Am/F (Em7 Dm7)
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,

Cmaj7   Gm7      C7     Fmaj7  Bb9
Help to make the season bright.

Am   Bb9             C         (F#m7)  B
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow,

     Em      A7      Dm7 G7  C
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.



               Gm7 C9         Gm7 C7
They know that Santa's on his way;

            Gm7              C9             (Fmaj9 or Fadd9)  Fmaj7
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,
          Ab           Bb9        Ebmaj7  Cm11
          Fm7          Bb7        Ebmaj7  Cm7
And every mother's child is gonna spy

          Am7             D7          Fm6  G7
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.



    C      Dm6           Em          Am/F  (Em7 Dm7)
And so I'm offering this simple phrase,

Cmaj7        Gm7    C7     Fmaj7  Bb9
To kids from one to ninety-two,

  Am              Bb9       C           B    (B7)
Although its been said many times, many ways,

(F)   C/G      Dm/G     C/G     Ab7 (F)   C/G  Dm/G  G7 C
Merry Christmas,  Merry Christmas,  Merry Christmas, to you.
