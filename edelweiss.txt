A   E7     A   D
Edelweiss, Edelweiss,
A     F#m         Bm    E(7)
every morning you greet me.
A         E7     A         D
Small and white, clean and bright,
A        E7       A
you look happy to meet me.

E          E7           A
Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow,
D         B7       E  E7
bloom and grow for-ev-er.
A   Em6    D   Dm
Edelweiss, Edelweiss,
A        E              A D A
bless my homeland for - e - ver.
