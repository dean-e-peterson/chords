   E                      G              A                        E
My child arrived just the other day,  He came to the world in the usual way,
                                   G                 A                     E
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay,  He learned to walk while I was away.
           D               A/C#         Bm
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
   G               Bm      E                  G         Bm      E
He said "I'm gonna be like you, dad, you know I'm gonna be like you"


CHORUS:
        E                           D
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
G                       A
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
E                              D
"When you comin' home dad?" "I don't know when,
    G           Bm       E       G                 Bm        E
But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then."


   E                       G                     A                              E
My son turned ten just the other day,  He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
                                     G                   A                     E
Can you teach me to throw?"  I said "Not today.  I got a lot to do."  He said "Thats OK."
   D       A/C#         Bm
He walked away, but his smile never dimmed,
   G                Bm      E                   G         Bm      E
It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah, You know I'm gonna be like him."


(CHORUS)

        E                          G              A                      E
Well he came from college just the other day,  So much like a man I just had to say,
                               G                   A                         E
"Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"   He shook his head, and he said with a smile,
          D            A/C#       Bm
"What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the (car) keys,
        G            Bm        E
See you later, can I have them please?"


(CHORUS)

Instrumental?: C  D  Bm  E  (2x)


     E                      G                  A                        E
I've long since retired, my son's moved away,  I called him up just the other day.
                               G                             A                      E
I said "I'd like to see you if you don't mind." He said "I'd love to dad if I could find the time
            D           A/C#           Bm
You see the new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
         G         Bm         E              G         Bm         E
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, dad, It's sure nice talkin' to you"

         D           A/C#       Bm
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,
     G        Bm        E       G       Bm        E
He'd grown up just like me.  My boy was just like me.


LAST CHORUS:
        E                           D
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
G                       A
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
E                              D
"When you comin' home son?" "I don't know when,
    G           Bm       E               G            Bm        E
But we'll get together then, dad.  We're gonna have a good time then."
