C       Dm7               Cmaj7/E       F
Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean,
C       Dm7     Cmaj7/E    F
Higher than any bird ever flew,
C       Dm7               Cmaj7/E         F
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens,
Eb           G7/D (G7) C    F/C  G
I've been in love with you.

C         Dm7     Cmaj7/E    F
Stronger than any mountain cathedral,
C      Dm7     Cmaj7/E    F
Truer than any tree ever grew,
C       Dm7     Cmaj7/E   F
Deeper than any forest primeval,
Eb      G7/D (G7) C
I am in love with you.

    Bbadd9/F  F     Abadd9/Eb    Eb
    I'll      bring fire in the winters;
    Bbadd9/F  F    Abadd9/Eb       Eb
    You'll    send showers in the springs.
    Bbadd9/F  F     Abadd9/Eb           Eb
    We'll     fly through the falls and summers
         G7sus4/C  G7/B        Gm7/Bb  G7/B
    With love           on our wings.

C             Dm7        Cmaj7/E        F
Through the years as the fire starts to mellow,
C         Dm7        Cmaj7/E      F
Burning lines in the book of our lives,
           C          Dm7           Cmaj7/E      F
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow,
Eb         G7/D (G7) C   C/D
I'll be in love with you.
Eb         G7/D (G7) C
I'll be in love with you.
