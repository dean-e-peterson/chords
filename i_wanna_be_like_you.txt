Am                                                     E7
Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh, the jungle V. I. P.
E7                                                                    Am
I've reached the top and had to stop and that's what's been botherin' me.
Am                                               E7
I wanna be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town.
E7                                                      Am   (G7)
And be just like the other men, I'm tired of monkeyin' 'round.

CHORUS:
G7  C                            A7
Oh, ooo-bee-ooo, I wanna be like you, ooh, ooh!
        D7             G7             C   A7  Dm7
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too-ooo-ooo.
(Dm7)  G7       C                         A7
You'll see it's true-ooo-ooo, an ape like me-eee-eee!
    D7             G7           C          A7  D7  G7
Can learn to be hu-ooo-ooo-man, too, ooh, ooh!

(Instrumental)

(Spoken)
Mogli:  Gee, Cousin' Louis, you're doin' real good!
Louis:  Now here's your part of the deal, cuz',
        Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.
Mogli:  But I don't know how to make fire.

Am                                                   E7
Now don't try to kid me man-cub.  I made a deal with you.
E7                                                     Am
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dreams come true.
Am                                                       E7
Now give me the secret man-cub, come on, clue me what to do.
E7                                                     Am  (G7)
Give me the pow'r of man's red flow'r so I can be like you.

CHORUS: (Baloo and Louis scatting)

(Not in the movie version)
I like your mannerisms, we'll be a set of twins
No one will know where man-cub ends and orangutan begins
And when I eat bananas, I won't peel them with my feet
'Cause I'll become a man-cub and learn some etti - keet.

CHORUS & OUTRO:
You-hoo-hoo, I wanna be like you-ooo-ooo!
        D7             G7             C
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too-ooo-ooo!
C#dim  Dm7 G7   C                   A7     D7          G7           C
You    see it's true:  someone like me can learn to be someone like me.
C  Bb  A A7  D7          G7           C
         Can learn to be someone like you.
C  Bb  A A7  D7          G7           C
         Can learn to be someone like you.
