       Bm                                Em                    Bm
I am a poor wayfaring stranger traveling through this world of woe,
                                                       Em              Bm
But there's no sickness, toil or danger in that bright land to which I go.
          G               D                 G                F#
I'm going there to see my Father; I'm going there no more to roam.
         Bm                          Em         Bm
I'm only going over Jordan; I'm only going over home.

            Bm                                      Em               Bm
I know dark clouds will gather 'round me. I know my way is rough and steep,
                                                    Em                   Bm
But golden fields lie just before me, where God's redeemed, their vigils keep.
          G               D                      G              F#
I'm going there to see my Mother, she said she'd meet me when I come.
         Bm                          Em         Bm
I'm only going over Jordan, I'm only going over home.

             Bm                             Em                  Bm
I'll soon be free of earthy trials, my body sleep in the church yard.
                                                 Em              Bm
I'll drop this cross of self-denial, and I'll go singing home to God.
          G                D                     G             F#
I'm going there to meet my Savior, to dwell with Him and never roam.
         Bm                          Em         Bm
I'm only going over Jordan, I'm only going over home.
