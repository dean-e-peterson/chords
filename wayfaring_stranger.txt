       Bm                                Em                    Bm
I am a poor wayfaring stranger traveling through this world of woe,
                                                       Em              Bm
But there痴 no sickness, toil or danger in that bright land to which I go.
          G               D                 G                F#
I知 going there to see my Father; I'm going there no more to roam.
         Bm                          Em         Bm
I知 only going over Jordan; I知 only going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather 池ound me. I know my way is rough and steep,
                                                    Em                   Bm
But golden fields lie just before me, where God痴 redeemed, their vigils keep.

I知 going there to see my Mother, she said she'd meet me when I come.

I知 only going over Jordan, I知 only going over home.

             Bm                             Em                  Bm
I値l soon be free of earthy trials, my body sleep in the church yard.
                                                 Em              Bm
I値l drop this cross of self-denial, and I値l go singing home to God.

I知 going there to meet my Savior, to dwell with Him and never roam.
