Cadd9   (x32020)     (Alternate chords to the swimming line: D Dsus2 Dsus4 D)

     G             Em         C        G
Come gather 'round people wherever you roam,
      G            Em      C              D
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
      G            Em             C               G
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
        G       Am           D
If your time to you is worth savin'.
       D            Cadd9              G/B         D/A
So you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone,
        G                 (C) D G
For the times, they are a-changin'.

     G           Em                C              G
Come writers and critics who prophecies with your pen,
    G              Em              C           D
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again,
    G               Em           C                G
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin,
            G          Am            D
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
        D     Cadd9       G/B      D/A
For the loser now will be later to win,
        G                 (C) D G
For the times, they are a-changin'.

     G           Em      C              G
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land,
    G          Em            C          D
And don't criticize what you don't understand.
     G             Em              C            G
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command;
     G           Am      D
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
       D              Cadd9          G/B          D/A
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand,
        G                 (C) D G
For the times, they are a-changin'.

     G         Em          C               G
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call,
      G            Em             C            D
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall,
    G            Em           C          G
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
          G         Am            D
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'.
      D               Cadd9       G/B         D/A
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls,
        G                 (C) D G
For the times, they are a-changin'.

    G          Em        C           G
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast;
    G        Em       C        D
The slow one now will later be fast,
       G       Em       C        G
As the present now will later be past.
    G        Am      D
The order is rapidly fadin'.
        D         Cadd9    G/B      D/A
And the first one now will later be last,
        G                 (C) D G
For the times, they are a-changin'.
