Twelve lords a-leaping,
Eleven ladies dancing,             Bob & Doug McKenzie lyrics:
Ten pipers piping,                 Twelve (good day and welcome to day 12,
Nine drummers drumming,                    choir interrupts jumping to 5th day)
Eight maids a-milking,             Eight comic books,
Seven swans a-swimming,                (Ah man, I keep forgettin'. This should
G           (G7)                        just be the 2 days of Christmas.)
Six geese a-laying,                Seven packs of smokes,
C    D        G                    Six packs of two-four,
Five gold(en) rings,               Five golden tuques,
G    G(7)    C                     Four pounds of back bacon,
Four calling birds,                  (There should be something more there,eh?)
F           (C)                    Three french toast,
Three French hens,                 Two turtlenecks,
D(m) (D)    G                      And a beer (in a tree, added starting day 4)
Two  turtle doves,
(G7)  C  F      C    G    C
And a partridge in a pear tree.
