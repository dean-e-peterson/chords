(G7)  C        G7     C                          G7       C
Step aside you ornery Tenderfeet, let a big, bad buckeroo past.
                 G7            C                 Em    B7     Em
I'm the toughest hombre you'll ever meet, though I may be the last.
       Am          Em                    Am             Dm7  G7
Yes-sirree we're a vanishing race, no-sirree can't last long.
      C         G7     C                  G7      C
Step aside, you ornery tenderfeet while I sing my song.

I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande,
                  F6   G7                   C     (Em/B)
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tanned,
      Am               Em
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow,
      Am                     Em
Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how,
      Am                   Em
And I sho' ain't fixin' to start in now.


F6       G7(+5) C  Am    F6       G7   C
Yippie-i-o-ky-  ay!      Yippie-i-o-ky-ay!


C     (Am7)   F6  G7            C
I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande,
                 F6  G7                  C     (Em/B)
And I learned to ride 'fore I learned to stand,
      Am                 Em
I'm a ridin' fool who is up to date,
  Am                      Em
I know ev'ry trail in the Lone Star State,
         Am                  Em
'Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-Eight.


F6       G7(+5) C  Am    F6       G7   C
Yippie-i-o-ky-  ay!      Yippie-i-o-ky-ay!

I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande,
              F6  G7                C     (Em/B)
and I come to town just to hear the band,
  Am                          Em
I know all the songs that the cowboys know
          Am                   Em
'Bout the big corral where the dogies go,
         Am                      Em
'Cause I learned them all on the radio.


F6       G7(+5) C  Am    F6       G7   C
