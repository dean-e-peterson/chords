Cmaj7   (x32000)

Intro (light like a ukelele?):  C  G  F  G

C                            Cmaj7
Raindrops keep falling on my head
    C7                               F               Em
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
A7               Em   A7
Nothing seems to fit, Those
Dm7                                               G7sus4
Raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'.


   G7     C                          Cmaj7
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun,
    C7                       F                 Em
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
A7              Em   A7
Sleepin' on the job, Those
Dm7                                               G7sus4
Raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'.


G7          C           Cmaj7
But there's one thing I know,
    F                  G                Em7
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
                      A7              Dm7           F  G  F  G
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me.


C                            Cmaj7
Raindrops keep falling on my head,
    C7                             F               Em(7)
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red,
A7              Em   A7
Cryin's not for me, 'Cause
Dm7                                          G7sus4
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.
  G7        C    Dm7                C
Because I'm free, nothings worryin' me.


(instrumental) C  Cmaj7  F  G  Em7
                      A7              Dm7           F  G  F  G
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me


(Repeat last verse)
