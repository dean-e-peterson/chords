  Em      G       Am  Bm7  Em
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
D   G      C       Am  Bm7  Em
And ransom captive Israel
     Am              Em A  D
That mourns in lowly exile here,
  G              Am Bm Em
Until the Son of God appear.

Chorus:
  G D       Em B(m)     Am  B  Em
  Rejoice!  Rejoice!  Emmanuel
  D     G       C       Am  Bm7  Em
  Shall come to thee, O Israel.


O come, thou Wisdom from on high,
Who ord'rest all things mightily;
To us the path of knowledge show
And teach us in her ways to go.

(Chorus)

O come, O come, thou Lord of might,
Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times didst give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.

(Chorus)

O come, thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From the depths of hell Thy people save
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

(Chorus)

O come, thou Key of David, come
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.

(Chorus)

O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spitis by thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight.

(Chorus)

O come, Desire of nations, bind
All peoples in one heart and mind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of Peace.

(Chorus)
