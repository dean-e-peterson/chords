Just As I Am

     D            A7      D
Just as I am, without one plea,
    A        A7        G        D
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
    D         D7        G
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!

     D            A7      D
Just as I am, and waiting not,
   A      A7      G        D
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
   D           D7        G
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!

     D             A7      D
Just as I am, tho' tossed about
     A      A7        G      D
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
     D        D7      G
Fightings within, and fears without,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!

     D             A7     D
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
     A        A7      G          D
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
  D         D7      G
Because Thy promise I believe,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!

     D            A7     D
Just as I am, Thy love unknown,
     A      A7    G       D
Hath broken ev'ry barrier down;
    D     D7         G
Now to be Thine, yea Thine alone,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!

     D           A7        D
Just as I am, of that free love,
    A                A7         G         D
The breadth, length, depth, the height to prove,
     D     D7     G
Here for a season then above,
  D             A       D
O Lamb of God I come, I come!
