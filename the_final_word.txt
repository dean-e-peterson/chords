C             F           G           C
You and me we use so very many clumsy words. 
    F        Am      Dm           G                    (G5)
The noise of what we often say is not worth being heard. 
         C               F             G           C
When the Father's Wisdom wanted to communicate His love, 
   F               Dm7           F  G
He spoke it in one final perfect Word.

Chorus: 
   C              Am              F               C
He spoke the Incarnation and then so was born the Son. 
                   Am                 F      G
His final Word was Jesus, He needed no other one. 
      C                  Am                 F            C
Spoke flesh and blood so He could bleed and make a way Divine. 
    F               Dm7            F      G       C
And so was born the baby who would die to make it mine. 

    C               F               G                 C
And so the Father's fondest thought took on flesh and bone. 
   F         Am      Dm               G                     (G5)
He spoke the living luminous Word, at once His will was done. 
    C              F              G              C
And so the transformation that in man had been unheard 
     F                Dm7          F                G
Took place in God the Father as He spoke that final Word. 

(Chorus)

    G              Am
And so the Light became alive 
    F            C
And manna became Man. 
 F               Dm
Eternity stepped into time 
   F             G
So we could understand. 

(Chorus, repeating final line a second time)
