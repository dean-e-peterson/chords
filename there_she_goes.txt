G     D   Cadd9  G         D     Cadd9 
There she goes,  There she goes again. 
G      D          Cadd9
Racing through my brain.
    Am     G        C
And I just can't contain.
     Am      G      C    D Dsus2
This feeling that remains.

G     D   Cadd9  G         D     Cadd9 
There she goes,  There she goes again.

Pulsing through my veins.

And I just can't contain.
     Am      G      C    D Dsus2
This feeling that remains.
