D            G                 D               A7
When I was a little bitty boy, just up off the floor,
D                     G               D           A7     D
We used to go down to Grandma's house every month-end or so.
                          G            D                      A7
We'd have chicken pie and country ham, homemade butter on the bread,
        D                     G                       A7                D
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house was her great big feather bed.

       D                                 G               D
It was nine feet high and six feet wide, soft as a downy chick.
       D
It was made from the feathers of forty-'leven geese,
       E7                          A7
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick.
     D                                      G                       D
It'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs and a piggy we stole from the shed.
                                G                   A7                D
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.

D                 G                        D                    A7
After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew,
D                       G                       D               A7        D
Pa would talk about the farm and the war and my Granny'd sing a ballad or two.
                       G                        D                 A7
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire 'till the cobwebs filled my head;
     D               G                             A7                        D
Next thing I know Id wake up in the morning in the middle of the old feather bed

{Refrain}

D                    G                D                 A7
Well I love my Ma, I love my Pa, love Gran' and Grandpa too,
     D                        G                         D    A7          D
Been fishing with my uncle, I rassled with my cousin, I even kissed Aunt Lou,
            G                       D                    A7
But if ever had to make a choice, I guess it ought to be said,
         D                       G                     A7                D
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road for Grandma's feather bed.

{Refrain}
