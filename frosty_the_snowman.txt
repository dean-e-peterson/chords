C                C7      F             C
Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul,
       F                  C
With a corncob pipe and a button nose,
        G7               C   G7
And two eyes made out of coal.

C                C7     F                 C
Frosty the Snowman is a fairy tale they say,
       F                    C          Am
He was made of snow but the children know
A7     Dm7     G7       C
How he came to life one day.

      F                   C (or Em?)    Dm7      G7       C   (Am)
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found.
    G                          Ddim      Am7    D7     G
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.

G7  C                C7     F                 C
Oh, Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be,
        F                     C           Am
And the children say he could laugh and play 
A7       Dm7     G7      C
Just the same as you and me.

C                C7         F                C
Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day,
      F                         C
So he said, "Lets run and we'll have some fun
      G7           C   G7
now before I melt away."

C                  C7       F                 C
Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
        F                   C             Am
Running here and there all around the square,
A7       Dm7      G7     C
Saying, "catch me if you can."

   F                 C                     Dm7    G7      C
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop.
       G                    Ddim    Am7       D7       G
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"

G7  C                C7       F            C
For Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way,
       F                      C          Am
But he waved goodbye saying, "Don't you cry,
A7      Dm7   G7        C
I'll be back again some day."

C                                                          G7
Thumpety thump thump, Thumpety thump thump, Look at Frosty go.
                                                              C
Thumpety thump thump, Thumpety thump thump, Over the hills of snow.
