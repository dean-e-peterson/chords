(D)      G                           Em
'Tis the gift to be simple, 'tis the gift to be free,

         Am/C              D                (D7)
'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be,

    G                             Em        (Em7)
And when we find ourselves in the place just right,

       Am                  D                G
       Am        (G/B)     Am/C  D(sus4)  D G
'Twill be in the valley of love  and      delight.

G            Em
G    Em      G          Em
When true simplicity is gain'd,

   Cmaj7   C  Cadd9   Am         D 
   G          Em      Am         D
   G          Em      Am/C       D
To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd,

   G               Em       (Em7)
To turn, turn will be our delight,

        Am                  D               G
        Am      (G/B)       Am/C  D(sus4) D G
Till by turning, turning we come  round     right.
