Home on the Range
 - words Dr Brewster Higley, music Dan Kelly, tenor range G2-C4 in C

    C                        F       (Dm7)
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,
          C                     G G7
Where the deer and the antelope play.
      C                    F
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
        C             G7         C
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

G7                C                                      G G7
Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play,
      C                    F         (Dm)          C             G          C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.

    F         (Dm7)          C
Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand,
                         G7
Flows leisurely down the stream;
          F                        C
Where the graceful white swan goes floating (or gliding?) along,
                          G G7
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.

          C                       F            (Dm7)
Where the air is so pure, and the zephyr(s) so free,
        C                    G G7
And the breezes so balmy and light,
  C         (C7)        F           (Dm)
I would not exchange my home on the range,
    C                  G7        C
For all of the (your?) cities so bright.

G7                C                                      G G7
Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play,
      C                    F         (Dm)          C             G          C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.

    C                         F           (Dm7)
How often a(t) night when the heavens are bright
         C                         G G7
With the light from the glittering stars.
  C                      F          (Dm)
I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
         C       G7            C
If their glory exceeds that of ours?

G7                C                                      G G7
Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play,
      C         (C7)       F         (Dm)          C             G7         C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.

(Additional words I don't like as much...)

Oh, I love those wild flow'rs in this dear land of ours
And the curlew, I love to hear scream
I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks
That are grazing on the mountaintops green

The red man was pressed from this part of the West,
He's likely no more to return
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
Their flickering campfires burn.
