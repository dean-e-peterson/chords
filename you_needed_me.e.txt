B7        E                  A
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry,
         B7                    E
I was confused, you cleared my mind,
                    E7        A
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me,
            F#7             B
And held me up, and gave me dignity,
            B7
Somehow you needed me.

(B7)        E                  A
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            B7                    E
To face the world, out on my own again.
                  E7   A      A#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   E                G#7    C#m F#7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    B7             E           G#7
You needed me, you needed me.

    (G#7) C#m                 E
    And I can't believe it's you,
                A            E
    I can't believe it's true.
      F#m7      B7            E     G#7
    I needed you and you were there.
             C#m               E                   A        E
    And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
                F#7                               B7
    'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares.

(B7)        E                A
You held my hand when it was cold.
           B7               E
When I was lost you took me home
                      E7    A
You gave me hope when I was at the end,
              F#7            B
And turned my lies back into truth again,
         B7
You even called me "friend".

(B7)        E                  A
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            B7                    E
To face the world, out on my own again.
                  E7   A      A#dim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   E                G#7    C#m F#7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    B7             E        C#7
You needed me, you needed me.
    F#7     B7     E        C#7 F#m7 B7sus4  B7  E
You needed me, you needed me.
