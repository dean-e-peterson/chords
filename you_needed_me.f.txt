C7        F                  Bb
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry,
         C7                    F
I was confused, you cleared my mind,
             F7               Bb
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me,
            G7              C
And held me up, and gave me dignity,
            C7
Somehow you needed me.

(C7)        F                  Bb
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            C7               F
To face the world, out on my own again.
              F7       Bb     Bdim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   F                A7     Dm  G7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    C7             F           A7
You needed me, you needed me.

    (A7)  Dm                  F
    And I can't believe it's you,
                Bb           F
    I can't believe it's true.
      Gm7       C7            F     A7
    I needed you and you were there.
             Dm                F                   Bb       F
    And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
                G7                                C7
    'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares.

(C7)        F                Bb
You held my hand when it was cold.
           C7               F
When I was lost you took me home
               F7           Bb
You gave me hope when I was at the end,
              G7             C
And turned my lies back into truth again,
         C7
You even called me "friend".

(C7)        F                  Bb
You gave me strength to stand alone again,
            C7                    F
To face the world, out on my own again.
              F7       Bb     Bdim
You put me high upon a pedestal,
   F                A7     Dm  G7
So high that I can almost see eternity,
    C7             F        D7
You needed me, you needed me.
    G7      C7     F        D7  Gm7  C7sus4  C7  F
You needed me, you needed me.
