      A               C#m         D
Guess mine is not the first heart broken.
   Bm7              E7       Amaj7   A6
My eyes are not the first to cry.

I'm not the first to know there's just no gettin' over you.


  A               C#m        D
I know I'm just a fool who's willing,
   Bm7            E7       Amaj7    A6
To sit around and wait for you.
     A               F#7         C#m7-5           F#7   Bm7
But, baby, can't you see there's nothin' else for me to do,
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7 (E7)  Dm   A
I'm hopelessly de - vo-ted to you.


(No chord)      Gm7                                         C7
But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside.
    F         Fmaj7 Adim         D7-9     Gm7
I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you,
             C7-9     Dm   F+   Dm7   Dm6  (or F/C in place of Dm7 ?)
Hopelessly devoted to you,
Gm7          C7-9     Dm   A
Hopelessly devoted to you.


   A                C#m      D
My head is sayin', "Fool, forget him."
   Bm7               E7        Amaj7   A6
My heart is sayin', "Don't let go.
A              F#7       C#m7-5          F#7     Bm7
Hold on to the end," and that's what I intend to do
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7 (E7)  Dm   A
I'm hopelessly de - vo-ted to you.


(No chord)      Gm7                                         C7
But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside.

I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you,

Hopelessly devoted to you,
