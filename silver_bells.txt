(E)  A               A7                    D       B7
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style;
       E             E7         A          Adim/A (or D)
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
E7       A                A7               D           B7
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile,
       E            E7            A    Adim/A (or D)  E7
And on every street corner you'll hear.


A             D             E              E7          A   D  Dsus2  D
Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
A            D          (B7) E            E7           A   D  E
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.


E          A                   A7                   D              B7
Strings of street lights, even stop lights, twinkle bright red and green,
       E             E7              A          Adim/A (or D)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
E7       A                    A7                  D           B7
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene,
    E              E7            A    Adim/A (or D)  E7
And above all this bustle you'll hear.


A             D             E              E7          A   D  Dsus2  D
Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
A            D          (B7) E            E7           A
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.
E            E7           F#m   B
Soon it will be Christmas day.
E            E7           A
Soon it will be Christmas day.
