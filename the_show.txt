I'm just a little bit caught in the middle,
G
Life is a maze and love is a riddle.
Am                                     Fmaj7                                 C
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone.  I've tried, and I don't know why,

C       G             Am               F                 C
Slow it down, make it stop, or else my heart is going to pop.
                G                 Am      Fmaj7            C
'Cause it's too much, yeah it's a lot, to be something I'm not.
      G           Am             Fmaj7          G  (Gsus4  G)
I'm a fool out of love, 'cause I just can't get enough.

I don't know where to go, can't do it alone.  I've tried, and I don't know why,
C
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment,
G
I'm so scared, but I don't show it.

I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down.  I know, I've got to let it go,
                   C
And just enjoy the show.

C          G          Am               Fmaj7
The sun is hot in the sky, just like a giant spotlight.
C          G          Am         Fmaj7          C
The people follow the signs, and synchronise in time.
       G            Am                Fmaj7         G
It's a joke, nobody knows, they got a ticket to the show.
