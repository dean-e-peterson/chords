          G                                 Am
There's a shining city, west of here, where dreams are booming into gear,
G                                          C   G    Am(7) G           D
It's no hum-drum nine to five town; it's a growing, going right alive town.

G                                       Am
Golden sparks light up the skies there, like a thousand Fourth of July's there.
G                                C       G  Am      Am7 Am  Am7 D        G
How I want to stake a claim, and roll up my sleaves and make a name in Detroit.

        G
You can hear it humming, see it coming, feel it everywhere you go!
     Am                                                                  D7
It's tomorrow morning, the future dawning with a bright and shining glow!
       G          Bm     Em           C             D
It's a land where golden chariots are molded out of dreams...
  Dsus4  D   G         D        D7          G (or Em7?
Detroit!   Detroit!  Detroit! Detroit! It's Detroit!

Oh, If I could be there, I'd be free there, standin' on my own two feet.
I'd invent new motors, design new rotors, I'd be in the driver's seat,
I'd make all my dreams realities. Oh I'd be on my way, in...
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit! Detroit! in Detroit!
