Introduction: Em  B7 Em                  F#m7b5 (xx4555) or (xx2212) or (234252)
                                         A#dim  (xx2323) or (345353) or (x12020)
                                         Am7    (x02010)
Em                                       Cmaj7  (x32000)
Round, like a circle in a spiral,        Gmaj7  (320002)
                      B7
Like a wheel within a wheel,
(B7)                                     (Em)
Never ending or beginning                Keys that jingle in your pocket,
                    Em                                             Am7
On an ever-spinning reel.                Words that jangle in your head,
                       E7                                     D7
Like a snowball down a mountain,         Why did summer go so quickly?
                 Am7                                               Gmaj7
Or a carnival balloon,                   Was it something that you said?
                       D7                                    G7
Like a carousel that's turning           Lovers walk along a shore
                         Gmaj7                                             Cmaj7
Running rings around the moon.           And leave their footprints in the sand.
                             Cmaj7                               F#7
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping    Is the sound of distant drumming
                        F#m7b5                                    Bm
Past the minutes on its face,            Just the fingers of your hand?
                         B7                                    E7
And the world is like an apple           Pictures hanging in a hallway
                     A#dim7                                    Am
Whirling silently in space,              And the fragment of a song.
                          B7                                       D7
Like the circles that you find           Half-remembered names and faces,
                         Em                                    Gmaj7
In the windmills of your mind.           But to whom do they belong?
                                                                   Cmaj7
                                         When you knew that it was over
                                                            F#m7b5
(Em)                                     Were you suddenly aware
Like a tunnel that you follow                                        B7
                   B7                    That the autumn leaves were turning
To a tunnel of its own,                                      Em
(B7)                                     To the color of her hair.
Down a hollow to a cavern
                        Em
Where the sun has never shone.
                         E7              (Em)
Like a door that keeps revolving         Like a circle in a spiral,
                    Am7                                        B7
In a half-forgotten dream,               Like a wheel within a wheel,
                      D7                 (B7)
Or the ripples from a pebble             Never ending or beginning
                    Gmaj7                                    A#dim7
Someone tosses in a stream.              On an ever-spinning reel.
                             Cmaj7                       Em/B
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping    As the images unwind,
                        F#m7b5                                     B7
Past the minutes on its face,            Like the circles that you find
                         B7                                       Em
And the world is like an apple           In the windmills of your mind.
                     A#dim7
Whirling silently in space,
                          B7
Like the circles that you find
                         Em
In the windmills of your mind.
