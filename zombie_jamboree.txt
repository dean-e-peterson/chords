         A
It was a zombie jamboree
                  E              A
Took place in the New York cemetery.
(A)
Oh, it was a zombie jamboree
                  E              A
Took place in the New York cemetery.
                 D              A
Zombies from all parts of the island
                 E              A
Some of them are great Calypsonians
          D               A
Since the season was carnival
           E                  A
They got together in bacchanal.
                  A7
And they were singing,

CHORUS:
D                  A
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
  E                            A                (A7)
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already.
D                 A
Oh, back to back, belly to belly
       E      (E7) A
It's a zombie jamboree.

Verse:
One female zombie she wouldn't behave
See how's she's dancing out of the grave.
In one hand she's holding a quart of rum
The other hand is knocking a conga drum.
You know the lead singer starts to make his rhyme
While the other zombie is rockin' in time.
One bystander, he had this to say:
"It was a trip to see the zombies break away."
SHAH! And they were singing:

(Repeat chorus twice)

A
Back to back! Everyone we sing back to back
And belly to belly then back to back
                               E
One two three four     Hey


What a zombie jamboree
From Times Square to the Statue of Liberty.
Uptown, downtown zombie jamboree
Whoa whoa whoa, yeah yeah.
There's a high-wire zombie 'tween the World Trades
A King Kong zombie on the Empire State,
But the biggest zombies Tokyo to Rome
The zombies who call the city home.
(Hah! What they do! Huh!)

(Repeat chorus to fade)
