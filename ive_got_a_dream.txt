I've Got a Dream
 - from Disney's Tangled, music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Glann Slater, tenor range E2-E4(G#4) in E

E                                                      Edim (xx2323) or (012020) or (345353)
I'm malicious, mean, and scary;                        B7b9 (x21212) or (x34445)
   A
My sneer could curdle dairy;
    E                F#7               B7
And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest.
    E
But despite my evil look,
E7     A              Edim                             G#m                             A
And my temper, And my hook,                            Tor would like to quit and be a florist.
     E                 B7           E                  E              B7       E
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.           Gunther does interior design.
                                                       G#m
                                                       Ulf is into mime,
          G#m                            C#m                    C#m
Can't you see me on the stage performing Mozart,       Attila's cupcakes are sublime,
F#7                             B7(b9) (B7)            F#7
Tickling the ivories until they gleam?                 Bruiser knits,
         E                (E7)                         F#7
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly                       Killer sews,
       A                Edim                           F#7
For my killer show tune medley (thank you),            Fang does little puppet shows,
        E               B7              E                  F#7                       B7
Because way down deep inside I've got a dream.         And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns. (ding)


(E)        A                                                  E                               [Flynn]
He's got a dream.                                      I have dreams like you, no really,
           E                                                A
He's got a dream.                                      Just much less touchy feely.
       G#m                C#m          F#m  B7              E             F#7                B7
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as i seem.           They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny.
         E                (E7)                               E             (E7)
Though I do like breaking femurs,                      On an island that I own,
        A                 Edim                                    A           Edim
You can count me with the dreamers.                    Tanned and rested and alone,
     E         B7              E                          E           B7               E
Like everybody else I've got a dream.                  Surrounded by enormous piles of money.


         E                                             (E)        A                        [Rapunzel]
I've got scars and lumps and bruises,                  I've got a dream, (She's got a dream)
     A                                                            E
Plus something here that oozes,                        I've got a dream, (She's got a dream)
    E              F#7           B7                           G#m           C#m               F#m  B7
And let's not even mention my complexion.              I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam.
      E              E7                                          E                  (E7)
But despite my extra toes,                             Yeah, and with every passing hour,
       A              Edim                                    A              Edim
And my goiter, And my nose,                            I'm so glad I left my tower.
  E            B7             E                             E              B7                E
I really wanna make a love connection.                 Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream.


          G#m                          C#m             E           A
Can't you see me with a special little lady,           She's got a dream, (He's got a dream)
F#7                          B7(b9) (B7)                             E
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?                   They've got a dream, (We've got a dream)
           E              (E7)                                G#m               C#m           F#m
Though I'm one disgusting blighter,                    So our differences ain't really that extreme,
      A            Edim                                              B7
I'm a lover, not a fighter.                            We're one big team.
      E               B7               E                       E               (E7)
Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream.          Call us brutal, sick, sadistic,
                                                              A            F#7
                                                       And grotesquely optimistic,
(E)         A                                                E               B7                C#m
(He's got a dream) I've got a dream,                   Cause way down deep inside, we've got a dream.
            E                                          C#m
(He's got a dream) I've got a dream,                   I've got a dream (5x)
      G#m            C#m                F#m  B7                   F#7
And I know one day romance will reign supreme.         I've got a dream.
          E                  (E7)                           E               Edim       B7    E
Though my face leaves people screaming,                Yes, way down deep inside, I've got a dream.
          A                Edim
There's a child behind it, dreaming.
     E         B7               E
Like everybody else, I've got a dream.
