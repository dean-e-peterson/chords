F#m A C#m E

F#m        A               C#m                E
Head under water, and they tell me to breathe easy for a while,
F#m                A            C#m    E
The breathing gets harder, even I know that,
F#m           A                    C#m         E
Made room for me, it's too soon to see, if I'm happy in your hands
F#m        A               C#m   E
I'm unusually hard to hold on to.
F#m             G#m          A       B
Blank stares at blank pages, no easy way to say this,
F#m           G#m                A
You mean well, but you make this hard on me,

                          F#m                   B                        E/G#          A
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see,
                          F#m                   B
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'cause you tell me
             E/G#                     A
It's make or break in this, if you're on your way,
              F#m          G#m
I'm not gonna write you to stay
   C#m                            F#/Bb                   A           B           F#m  A  C#m  E
If all you have is leaving, I'mma need a better reason to write you a love song today,  today.


F#m           A                   C#m     E
I learned the hard way, that they all say things you wanna hear,
F#m          A           C#m       E
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under
F#m                  A                     C#m            E                      F#m
You and your twisted words, your help just hurts, you are not what I thought you were.
   A     C#m      E
Hello to high and dry.
F#m         G#m            A             B                 F#m
Convinced me to please you, made me think that I need this too,
          G#m         A
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am.


                          F#m                   B                        E/G#          A
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see,
                          F#m                   B
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'cause you tell me
             E/G#                     A
It's make or break in this, if you're on your way,
              F#m          G#m
I'm not gonna write you to stay,
   C#m                            F#/Bb                   A           B         C#m
If all you have is leaving, I'mma need a better reason to write you a love song today.


        G#m  A                 E     B   C#m         G#m  A                 E     B
Promise me,   you'll leave the light on;  to help me see   with daylight my guide gone,
C#m        G#m             A           B
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me because I say


                    F#m                   B                        E/G# (G#m?)   A
I won't write you a love song, 'cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see,
                          F#m                   B                     E/G#
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'Cause you tell me, it's make or break in this,
   A                     F#m                    B                        E/G#          A
Is that why you wanted a love song?  'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see,
                          F#m                   B
I'm not gonna write you a love song, 'cause you tell me
             E/G#                     A
It's make or break in this, if you're on your way,
              F#m          G#m
I'm not gonna write you to stay,
        A                               B
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute,
           C#m                         F#/Bb
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas, when I believe that there's a reason
   A           B           F#m  A  C#m  E  F#m  A  C#m  E
To write you a love song today,  today.
