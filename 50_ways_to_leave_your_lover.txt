Em/G            D6              Cmaj7              B7-9  B7
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me.
Em             Bm7         D#dim         B7-9
"The answer is easy if you take it logic'lly.
Em          D6               Cmaj7          B7-9
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free;
      B7     Em     Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover."
Em/G            D6            Cmaj7      B7-9
She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude;
B7      Em             Bm7              D#dim         B7-9
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued.
            Em        D6      Cmaj7         B7-9
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude;
      B7      Em    Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover.
              Em    Am7                Em
              Fifty ways to leave your lover."

Chorus:
                  G                       Bb6
Just slip out the back, Jack.  Make a new plan, Stan;
                     C7                          G7
You don't need to be coy, Roy, just get yourself free.
                  (On repeat:  you just listen to me.)
           G                              Bb6
Hop on the bus, Gus; you don't need to discuss much;
                  C7                         G7
Just drop off the key, Lee, and get yourself free.

(repeat Chorus)


Em/G          D6               Cmaj7           B7-9
She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain;
  B7            Em                  Bm7  D#dim           B7-9
I wish there was somethin' I could do to make you smile again."
              Em          D6    Cmaj7               B7-9
I said, "I appreciate that, and would you please explain about the
B7    Em  Am7  Em
fifty ways?"

Em/G           D6                 Cmaj7              B7-9
She said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight;
    B7  Em           Bm7              D#dim          B7-9
and I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light."
             Em              D6           Cmaj7        B7-9
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right;
      B7      Em    Am7                Em
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover,
              Em    Am7                Em
              Fifty ways to leave your lover.

(repeat Chorus 2x)
