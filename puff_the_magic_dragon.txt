Puff, the magic drag-on lived by the sea,
    F                C      Am        D7                   G7
and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Ho-nah-Lee,
C             Em    F                 C
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff,
    F                       C       Am      D7    G7    C      G7
and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh!


C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea,
    F                C      Am        D7                   G7
and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Ho-nah-Lee,

  C                 Em          F                      C
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail,
F             C       Am7        D7              G7
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail,
C               Em            F                 C
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
F                  C           Am7       D7          G7      C     G7
Pirate ships would low'r their flag when Puff roared out his name. Oh!


  C               Em       F             C
A dragon lives forever but not so little boys,
F                 C     Am7        D7            G7
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys,
C                 Em               F             C
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
    F                C       Am7     D7         G7       C     G7
And Puff that mighty dragon,      he ceased his fearless roar. Oh!


    C                Em      F                          C
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
F              C       Am7   D7              G7
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane,
    C                Em     F                 C
Without his lifelong friend Puff could not be brave,
   F                C       Am7   D7        G7     C     G7
So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave. Oh!

      D7            G7         C F C G7 C
Coda: land  called  Ho - nah - Lee.


(Additional happy ending verses, possibly by Amber McInnis:)

Jackie he got married, and they had a little babe.
Jackie's daughter Sophie went adventuring one day.
Happily she wandered down the misty beach alone.
And passing by a hidden cave, she heard a muffled groan.

Bravely Sophie slipped into the place where Puff did dwell.
The startled dragon spun around and frightened her as well.
Then she saw his lonely eyes, and quickly lost her fears.
She kissed the dragon's scaly nose and wiped away his tears.
