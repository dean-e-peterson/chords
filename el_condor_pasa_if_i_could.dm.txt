El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could) (in Dm)
 - music by Alomía Robles, based on Andean folk tunes, and maybe Jorge Milchberg
 - English lyrics by Paul Simon


Am  Dm                         F
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail.
C     F      C    F        C      Dm      Am  Dm
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would.  Hmm-mmm.

Am  Dm                        F
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail.
C     F           C    F        C      Dm      Am  Dm  (Dm/C)
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.  Hmm-mmm.


Bridge:
 A#
Away, I'd rather sail away,
(Gm7)  F           (C)      F    Am
Like a swan that's here and gone.
  A#
A man gets tied up to the ground,
   (Gm7)     F          (C)     F
He gives the world it's saddest sound,
     C       Dm     Am  Dm
It's saddest sound, hmm-mmm.


Am  Dm                        F
I'd rather be a forest than a street.
C     F      C    F        C      Dm    Am  Dm
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would.

Am  Dm                               F
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet.
C     F           C    F        C     Dm     Am  Dm
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.
