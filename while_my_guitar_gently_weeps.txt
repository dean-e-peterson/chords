Am6/F#  (202212)
Fmaj7   (xx3210) or (102210)?
Amaj7   (x02120)

  Am          Am/G        Am6/F#            Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping,
Am          G          D     E
While my guitar gently weeps.
  Am          Am/G        Am6/F#       Fmaj7
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping,
Am          G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps.

(Chorus)
         (Amaj7?)      (A?)
A            C#m F#m    Amaj7   Bm                  E
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love.
A            C#m F#m        Amaj7       Bm                    E
I don't know how someone controlled you, they bought and sold you.

  Am          Am/G        Am6/F#      Fmaj7
I look at the world and I notice it's turning,
Am          G          D     E
While my guitar gently weeps.
     Am       Am/G         Am6/F#    Fmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning,
Am          G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps.

A            C#m F#m        Amaj7  Bm                   E
I don't know how you were diverted, you were perverted, too.
A            C#m F#m        Amaj7  Bm              E
I don't know how you were inverted, no-one alerted you.

  Am            Am/G         Am6/F#       Fmaj7
I look from the wings at the play you are staging,
Am          G          D     E
While my guitar gently weeps.
       Am          Am/G       Am6/F#      Fmaj7
'Cause I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging,
Am          G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps.

(Alternate ending verse)
  Am          Am/G        Am6/F#            Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping,
Am          G          D     E
While my guitar gently weeps.
Am          Am/G     Am6/F#  Fmaj7
Look at you all...
Am          G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps.
