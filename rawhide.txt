Am
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'  (4x)    Rawhide

Am
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin', though the streams are swollen,
C
Keep them doggies rollin', Rawhide!
Am                         Dm            Am
Rain and wind and weather, hell bent for leather,
G          F              E
Wishin' my gal was by my side.
Am                               Dm                Am
All the things I'm missin', good vittles, love and kissin',
    G              Am  Em    Am
Are waitin' at the end of my ride.

CHORUS:
Am                                 E
Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on,
         Am                  E
Move 'em on, head 'em up, Rawhide!
        Am                         E
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em in, cut 'em out,
        Am  (Dm   E)  F   E  Am
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, Rawhide!

     Am
Keep movin' movin' movin', though they're disapprovin',
C
Keep them doggies movin', Rawhide!
      Am                           Dm              Am
Don't try to understand them, just rope, throw and brand 'em,
G             F               E
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
Am                         Dm                Am
My heart's calculatin', my true love will be waitin',
   G              Am  Em    Am
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.

(Chorus)

Am  C  Am  C
Am  Dm  Am  Dm  Am  G  Am

(Chorus)

Am
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'  (4x)    Rawhide
