Anna Nalick's album "Wreck of the Day" is absolutely amazing! ...
I was able to see a live performance of this song (amazing) ...
With Aadd9, her guitar player Luis tends to put his pinky on the G string on and off...
does it during "Hypocrites you're all here for the very same REASON"
Similarly, it can also be done while playing E in places like "hands" during the
chorus. (B7sus4)  Just play with the pinky on the G string again.

A       (x07650) and (x02220)                           Aadd9   (x07600)
Bm      (x24432)                                        D       (xx0232)
G       (355433) or (320033) (2nd one during chorus)    Esus4   (022200)

Aadd9                                  G
2am and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake,
                                    D
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
                                        Aadd9
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season.
Aadd9                                            G
Yeah, we walk through the door so accusing their eyes
                                        D
Like they have any right at all to criticize
                                             Aadd9
Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason.

Bm                                          D
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable and
A                        E                    Bm                    D
Life's like an hourglass glued to the table.  No one can find the rewind button, girl,
A                           E Esus4 E     G    D       Aadd9          G    D       Aadd9
So cradle your head in your hands.    And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe.

Aadd9                           G
May he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss
                                           D
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
                                        Aadd9
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year.
Aadd9                                          G
Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while,
                                          D
But my god it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
                                     Aadd9
Wanna hold him maybe I'll just sing about it.

Bm                                          D
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable and
A                        E                    Bm                    D
Life's like an hourglass glued to the table.  No one can find the rewind button, boys
A                           E Esus4 E     G    D       Aadd9          G    D       Aadd9
So cradle your head in your hands.    And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe.

(Bridge)
Bm                            D
There's a light at each end of this tunnel you shout
             A                       E
Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
      Bm                                D
These mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
   A                       E
If you'll only try turnin' around

Aadd9                        G
2am and I'm still awake writing a song
                                      D
If I get it all down on paper it's no longer
                                     Aadd9
Inside of me, threatnin' the life it belongs to.
Aadd9                                     G
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
                                             D
Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud
                                             Aadd9
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to.

Bm                                          D
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable and
A                        E                    Bm                    D
Life's like an hourglass glued to the table.  No one can find the rewind button, now
A                    E Esus4 E     G    D       Aadd9          G    D       Aadd9
Sing it if you understand.     And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe.  (etc)
