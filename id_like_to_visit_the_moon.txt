I'd Like to Visit the Moon
- The Chenille Sisters
- Also sung by Ernie on Sesame Street

         C       Em/B      Am Am/G
Well I'd like to visit the moon
     F           G           C
On a rocket ship high in the air.
        C       Em/B      Am Am/G
Yes I'd like to visit the moon
      F               G            C
But I don't think I'd like to live there.
           F            C           G           C
Though I'd like to look down at the Earth from above
        F            C          G        C
I would miss all the places and people I love
     F              C           G        Am
So although I might like it for one afternoon
  F             G           C
I don't want to live on the moon.

            C      Em/B      Am Am/G
I'd like to travel under the sea
        F            G         C
I could meet all the fish everywhere.
        C      Em/B      Am Am/G
Yes I'd travel under the sea
      F               G            C
But I don't think I'd like to live there.
        F          C            G        C
I might stay for a day there if I had my wish
            F           C            G               C
But there's not much to do when your friends are all fish
       F          C           G        Am
And an Oyster and Clam aren't real family
     F             G           C
So I don't want to live in the sea.

            F         C               G     C
I'd like to visit the jungle hear the lions roar.
F          C               G   C
Go back in time and meet a dinosaur.
        F       C              G           Am
There's so many strange places I'd like to be
    F            G        C
But none of them permanently.

      C        Em/B      Am Am/G
So if I should visit the moon
          F          G             C
Well I'll dance on a moon beam and then
       C      Em/B      Am Am/G
I will make a wish on a star
         F          G          C
And I'll wish I was home once again.
       F           C                G           C
Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
        F            C          G        C
I would miss all the places and people I love.
     F            C           G           Am
So although I may go, I'll be coming home soon
         F             G           Am
'Cause I don't want to live on the moon.
     F             G           C   Em/B Am Am/G F G C
No I don't want to live on the moon.
