Intro: C/E  C/F  C/G  Am7  F  G  C


C/E   C/F      C/G    Am7 F    G      C
I set out on a narrow way many years ago,
C/E    C/F     C/G       Am7   F        G      C
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road.
    Am           G             F        Am/E          Dm7
But I got lost a time or two.  Wiped my brow and kept pushin' through.
C/E        C/F     G     Am   F       G           C (Csus4) C
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you.

CHORUS:
C          F         C               G         C
That every long lost dream led me to where you are.
           F        Am7                   F        G
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars,
            F     C             G      Am                 Dm C    F
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms.  This much I know is true.
     C/E C/F         C/G    Am7       F      G           C/E C/F C/G Am7 F G C
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.


C/E     C/F       C/G        Am7   F     G       C
I think about the years I've spent, just passin' through.
    C/E     C/F      C/G    Am7  F            G       C
I'd like to have the time I lost, and give it back to you.
    Am                 G              F           Am/E       Dm7
But you just smile and take my hand.  You've been there, you understand.
C/E     C/F       G       Am   F       G      C (Csus4) C
Its all part of a grander plan that is comin' true.

(Chorus)

                 F       C            G       Am                 Dm C    F
And now I'm just rolling home into my lover's arms.  This much I know is true.
     C/E C/F         C/G    Am7       F      G           C
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.
     C/E C/F         C/G    Am7       F      G           C
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.
