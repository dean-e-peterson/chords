             C
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
       G7
In the lane, snow is glistening,

A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight.
D7           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland.

C
Gone away is the bluebird,
        G7
Here to stay is a new bird,

He sings a love song, as we go along,
D7           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland.

E             B7             E
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
                  B7           E
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown.
G                  D7                   G
He'll say: Are you married?  We'll say: No man,
    A7             D7                 Dm7  G  G7
But you can do the job when you're in town.

      C
Later on, we'll conspire,
      G7
As we dream by the fire,

To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
D7           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland.


[END: It usually ends here...and that's probably just as well.]

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown.
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling.
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
