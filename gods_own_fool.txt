God's Own Fool
- by Michael Card

INTRO:
F  C  G  Am Em F  G  C

VERSE 1:
       C                       G         C
    It seems I've imagined Him all of my life
           F         C         G
    As the wisest of all of mankind
           F          C         G          Am  G (or Em, or Em/G?)
    But if God's Holy wisdom is foolish to men
       F                G          C
    He must have seemed out of His mind

        F        C      G           C
    For even His family said He was mad
            F              C          G
    And the priests said a demon's to blame
        F          C            G           Am  G
    But God in the form of this angry young man
          F               G         C
    Could not have seemed perfectly sane

BRIDGE:
         F         C           G               C   Em (or G, or Em/G?)
    When we in our foolishness thought we were wise
    Am                        Em         F
    He played the fool and He opened our eyes
         C                    G              C     Em
    When we in our weakness believed we were strong
    Am                    F       G    C
    He became helpless to show we were wrong

CHORUS:
        F     C      G         C         F        C           G
    And so we follow God's own fool, for only the foolish can tell
      F         C   G    Am  G    F         G       C
    Believe the unbelievable, and come be a fool as well

INSTRUMENTAL:
    F  C  G  Am Em F  G  C

VERSE 2:
       C                         G           C
    So come lose your life for a carpenter's son
          F          C          G
    For a madman who died for a dream
        F               C               G         Am  G
    And you'll have the faith His first followers had
        F               G             C
    And you'll feel the weight of the beam

          F          C         G            C
    So surrender the hunger to say you must know
             F          C       G
    Have the courage to say I believe
            F        C       G          Am  G
    For the power of paradox opens your eyes
        F                G            C
    And blinds those who say they can see

BRIDGE:
         F         C           G               C   Em
    When we in our foolishness thought we were wise
    Am                        Em         F
    He played the fool and He opened our eyes
         C                    G              C     Em
    When we in our weakness believed we were strong
    Am                    F       G    C
    He became helpless to show we were wrong

CHORUS:
        F     C      G         C         F        C           G
    And so we follow God's own fool, for only the foolish can tell
      F         C   G    Am  G    F         G       C
    Believe the unbelievable, and come be a fool as well

    F     C      G         C         F        C           G
    So we follow God's own fool, for only the foolish can tell
      F         C   G    Am  G    F         G       C
    Believe the unbelievable, and come be a fool as well

OUTRO:
    F  C  G  Am Em F  G  C
