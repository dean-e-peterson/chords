C                  Dm
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
G7                                     C
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee.
C                        Dm
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
G7                                       C
Lulled by the moonlight have all passed away.

G7                 C
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
Am               D7        G7
List while I woo thee with soft melody.
C                     Dm
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,
G7                            C  E7  Am
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me,
F         C        G7         C
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me.

C                  Dm
Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
G7                                 C
Mermaids are chanting the wild Lorelei,
C                  Dm
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
G7                                   C
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.

G7                 C
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
Am          D7          G7
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea,
C                       Dm
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart.
G7                            C  E7  Am
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
F         C        G7         C
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
