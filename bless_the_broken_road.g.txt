 - by Rascal Flatts, "Feels Like Today" Album (2004)

Intro: G/B  G/C  G/D  Em  C  D  G


G/B   G/C      G/D    Em  C    D      G
I set out on a narrow way many years ago,
G/B    G/C     G/D       Em    C        D      G
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road.
    Em           D             C        Em/B          Am7
But I got lost a time or two.  Wiped my brow and kept pushin' through.
G/B        G/C     D     Em   C       D           G (Gsus4) G
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you.

CHORUS:
G          C         G               D         G
That every long lost dream led me to where you are.
           C        Em                    C        D
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars,
            C     G             D      Em                 Am G    C
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms.  This much I know is true.
     G/B G/C         G/D    Em        C      D           G/B G/C G/D Em C D G
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.


G/B     G/C       G/D        Em    C     D       G
I think about the years I've spent, just passin' through.
    G/B     G/C      G/D    Em   C            D       G
I'd like to have the time I lost, and give it back to you.
    Em                 D              C           Em/B       Am7
But you just smile and take my hand.  You've been there, you understand.
G/B     G/C       D       Em   C       D      G (Gsus4) G
Its all part of a grander plan that is comin' true.

CHORUS:
G          C         G               D         G
That every long lost dream led me to where you are.
           C        Em                    C        D
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars,
            C     G             D      Em                 Am G    C
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms.  This much I know is true.
     G/B G/C         G/D    Em        C      D           G/B G/C G/D Em C D G
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.


                 C       G            D       Em                 Am G    C
And now I'm just rolling home into my lover's arms.  This much I know is true.
     G/B G/C         G/D    Em        C      D           G
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.
     G/B G/C         G/D    Em        C      D           G
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.
