Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
       G7                      F/C  C
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
G/B  Am  D7       F  C
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


C        Bm7      E7             Am       Am/G  F
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
          G7             F/C  C
There's a shadow hanging o -  ver me,
G/B  Am    D7       F  C
Oh,  yesterday came suddenly.


    (Chorus)
    Bm(7) E7  Am  G  F(maj7)     Dm        G7       C
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    D/E  E7   Am  G     F(maj7)      Dm       G     C
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


C         Bm7       E7           Am       Am/G  F
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      G7              F/C  C
Now I need a place to hide away,
G/B  Am  D7       F  C
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.


    (Chorus)
    Bm(7) E7  Am  G  F(maj7)     Dm        G7       C
    Why   she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
    D/E  E7   Am  G     F(maj7)      Dm       G     C
    I    said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.


C         Bm7       E7           Am        Am/G  F
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
      G7              F/C  C
Now I need a place to hide away,
G/B  Am  D7       F  C         C/G   D/F#  F  C
Oh,  I believe in yesterday.   Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm-mm-mmm.
