Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
 - words by Robert Robinson, music by John Wyeth
 - D is original key I think


(A)       D              A
Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
(D)     G        A        D
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
(A)        D            A
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
(D)      G        A       D
Call for songs of loudest praise.
(F#m)    Bm   F#m G         D
Teach me some mel-odious sonnet,
(F#m)   Bm      F#m      G
Sung by flaming tongues above;
A7         D                  A     (or Em A)
Praise the mount!  I'm fixed upon it,
D        G (D) A(7)    D
Mount of Thy redeeming love.


(A)    D            A
Here I raise my "Ebenezer"
(D)    G      A      D
Hither by Thy help I come.
(A)   D                 A
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
(D)    G    A       D
Safely to arrive at home.
(F#m) Bm    F#m G           D
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
(F#m)     Bm       F#m     G
Wandering from the fold of God;
A7     D              A
He, to rescue me from danger,
D    G     (D) A(7)     D
Interposed His precious blood.


(A)    D                 A
Oh, to grace how great a debtor,
(D)   G      A           D
Daily I'm constrained to be!
(A)     D                A
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
(D)     G         A        D
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
(F#m)    Bm F#m  G            D
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
(F#m)    Bm        F#m   G
Prone to leave the God I love;
A7        D                     A
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
D       G   (D) A(7)    D
Seal it for Thy courts above.
