I Sing with Joy and Gladness
 - music and original Swedish by Nils Frykman, translated by E. Gustav Johnson

  E                              F#m              B7
I sing with joy and gladness, my soul has found release;
                                    E                  E7
Now free from sin and sadness, with God I live in peace:
    A                    E
His everlasting mercy to me has been revealed,
                B7             E
His truth in my heart has been sealed.



   E                     F#m           B7
My former resolutions to lead a better life
                             E                       E7
Were only vain delusions, my soul was still at strife:
    A                       E
Now on the love of Jesus completely I rely,
              B7         E
For me he was willing to die.


     E                                F#m             B7
When thoughts of guilt oppress me and I thru weakness fail,
                                  E                 E7
The Savior yet will bless me, his mercy does prevail:
   A                           E
Forgiveness for the sinner his loving heart provides,
                 B7    E
His faithfulness ever abides.


    E                  F#m         B7
The evil adversary may in his fury smite;
                              E                 E7
I fear not, for I carry God's armor in the fight:
    A                              E
The word, divine and mighty, shall victory obtain,
                      B7     E
Its strength shall forever remain.


     E                            F#m          B7
Thus marching on courageous, with joy I see my goal,
                              E               E7
The blessing of the ages, the haven of my soul:
    A                         E
And on the pilgrim journey my voice in song I raise,
              B7        E
My God and my Savior to praise.
