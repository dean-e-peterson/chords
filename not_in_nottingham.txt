Not in Nottingham
 - by Roger Miller? from Disney's animated Robin Hood
 - chords by Oliver Lockwood and Juliette Blum, slightly modified

      A   A7                D
Every town, has its ups and down.
         A                  E    E7
Sometime ups, outnumber the downs,
                  A  A7
But not in Nottingham.

                  D
I'm inclined to believe
              A
If we were so down,
            E
We'd up and leave

                                           D
We'd up and fly if we had wings for flyin'.
                                           E
Can't you see the tears we're cryin'?
                                           E7
Can't there be some happiness for me?
              A
Not in Nottingham.
