Intro:  Am  C  D  F  Am  C  E

      Am   C        D     F
There is a house in New Orleans,
     Am       C      E
They call the Rising Sun,
         Am       C       D           F
And It's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    Am     E         Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
And God, I know, I'm one.

   Am     C     D      F
My mother was a tailor,
    Am       C        E
She sewed my new blue jeans.
   Am     C     D        F
My father was a gambling man
Am      E     Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
Down in New Orleans.

        Am   C        D       F
And the only things a gambler needs
     Am       C     E
Is a suitcase and a trunk.
        Am   C         D    F
And the only time he's satisfied
   Am        E     Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
Is when he's all a-drunk.

         Am       C      D        F
I've got one foot on the platform,
    Am         C      E
The other foot on the train.
    Am    C       D     F
I'm going back to New Orleans
   Am       E        Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
To wear the ball and chain.

   Am       C         D        F
So mothers, tell your children
       Am      C      E
Not to do what I have done,
           Am      C       D    F
Spend your life in sin and misery,
       Am           E      Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E
In the house of the Rising Sun.

      Am   C        D     F
There is a house in New Orleans,
     Am       C      E
They call the Rising Sun,
         Am       C       D           F
And It's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    Am     E         Am    C  D  F  Am  E  Am  E    Am    C
And God, I know, I'm one.
