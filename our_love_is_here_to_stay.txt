Intro:
(key may be two half steps lower than main part??)
The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend.
The world with all its capers and how it all will end.
Nothing seems to be lasting; but, that isn't our affair.
We've got something permanent, I mean in the way we care.

C7        G9    Gm7         C7      F    Gm7
It's very clear our love is here to stay.
    C7    G7    Gm7      C7    Eb9  D9
Not for a year, but ever and a day.
    G7 C7 D7      Gm7
The radio and the telephone
C7      Fmaj7  Bbmaj7  Gm6  A7
And the movies that we know
            Dm             G7                Gm7  C7
May just be passing fancies, and in time may go.

           G9    Gm7         C7      F    Gm7
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay.
  C7     G7   Gm7     C7         Eb9  D9
Together were going a long, long way.
   G7       C7          D7
In time the rockies may crumble,
   Gm7        C7     Eb9
Gibraltar may tumble,
             D7      Gm7
They're only made of clay,
Ddim  F    (D7)     Gm7 C7  F     (F6, Gm7 if going to repeat?)
But     our love is here to stay.
