The MTA Song
 - words by Jacqueline Steiner and Bess Lomax Hawes, in G

G                              C         (Am7)        G                  D  (D7)
Let me tell you the story of a man named Charlie on a tragic and fateful day.
       G                                   C        (Am7)           G           D7 G
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family, went to ride on the MTA.


   (CHORUS:)
    G                         C       (Am7)           G               D      (D7)
    Did he ever return, no he never returned, and his fate is still unlearn'd.
           G       (G7)            C          (Cm)             G       D       G
    He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston, he's the man who never returned.

G                                  C              (Am7)
Charlie handed in his dime, at the Kendall Square Station
       G                   D    (D7)
And he changed for Jamaica Plain.
        G                                  C        (Am7)
When he got there the conductor told him, "One more nickel."
        G             D7       G
Charlie could not get off that train.

   (CHORUS, optional)

G                          C                 (Am7)           G                   D (D7)
Now all night long Charlie rides through the station crying "What will become of me?"
    G                      C         (Am7)          G         D7    G
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea, or my cousin in Roxbury?"

   (CHORUS)

G                               C              (Am7)
Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station,
      G                   D  (D7)
Every day at quarter past two,
    G                                 C         (Am7)
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
       G           D7       G
As the train comes rumblin' through.

   (CHORUS)

(Kingston Trio replaced this verse with a banjo solo?)
 G                           C             (Am7)
 As his train rolled on underneath Greater Boston,
 G                         D     (D7)
 Charlie looked around and sighed:
            G                           C          (Am7)
 "Well, I'm sore and disgusted, and I'm absolutely busted;
         G          D7        G
 I guess this is my last long ride."


G                                     C            (Am7)
Now you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal
         G                      D  (D7)
That the people have to pay and pay.
G                                  C        (Am7)
Fight the fare increase!  Vote for Walter O'Brien!
         G               D7 G     (George O'Brien in Kingston Trio rendition)
Get poor Charlie off the MTA.

   (END CHORUS:)
    G                                    C       (Am7)              G         D    (D7)
    Or else he'll never return, no he'll never return, and his fate will be unlearn'd.
           G       (G7)            C          (Cm)             G       D       G
    He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston, he's the man who never returned.
                     D       G                         D       G
    He's the man who never returned.  He's the man who never returned.
