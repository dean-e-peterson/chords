(Chorus:)
G        D      G        D
Bye bye, love.  Bye bye, happiness.
G      D                        A     D
Hello, loneliness.  I think I'm gonna cry.

G        D      G        D
Bye bye, love.  Bye bye, sweet caress.
G      D                       A       D
Hello, emptiness.  I feel like I could die.
            A           D
Bye bye, my love, goodbye.


D             A  (A7)           D
There goes my baby with someone new.
D              A   (A7)         D
She sure looks happy; I sure am blue.
D          G                     A
She was my baby 'till he stepped in.
            A7                      D   (G  D)
Goodbye, to romance that might have been.


(Chorus)


D                A     (A7)                 D
I'm through with romance.  I'm through with love.
D                A     (A7)          D
I'm through with counting the stars above,

D              G                  A
And here's the reason that I'm so free:
          A7                   D   (G  D)
My lovin' baby is through with me.


(Chorus)

(repeat and fade)  Goodbye, my love goodbye.
