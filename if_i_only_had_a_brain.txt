D7      G              Am7      Bm7              C           G                Am7  Bm7
I could while away the hours conferrin' with the flowers, consulting with the rain;
Bbm7   C       (C/B) Am7        Am7/G    D            (D7)  D6       D7   G          Am7  Bm7  D9
And my head I'd be a scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin' if I only had a brain.

      G           Am7        Bm7     C         G             Am7   Bm7
I'd unravel ev'ry riddle for any individdle in trouble or in pain.
Bbm7     C              (C/B)   Am7       Am7/G   D  (D7)    D6      D7   G          Am7  G  G7
With the thoughts (that) I'd be thinkin', I could be another Lincoln if I only had a brain.

(Bridge:)
    C  C#dim                Bm7-5  E7    Am7     D7       G    Em
Oh, I   --   could tell you why  --  the ocean's near the shore,
        F#m7                B7            Em  B+
I could think of things I'd never thunk before,
             A7                 D
And then I'd sit and think some more.

D7      G             Am7         Bm7              C            G                 Am7  Bm7
I would not be just a nuffin', my head all full of stuffin', my heart all full of pain;
Bbm7    C    (C/B)   Am7    Am7/G      D   (D7)    D6    D7   G          Am7   Bm7  Am7  G
I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry if I only had a brain.

(Additional Scarecrow verse:)
D7     G                Am7          Bm7            C          G                Am7   Bm7
Ya, it would be kind of pleasin', to reason out the reason for things I can't explain,
Bbm7    C   (C/B)  Am7       Am7/G   D  (D7)    D6      D7   G          Am7   Bm7  Am7  G
Then perhaps I'd deserve you and be even worthy erv you if I only had a brain.


("If I Only Had A Heart", Tin Man verse:)
D7     G              Am7        Bm7              C          G             Am7   Bm7
When a man's an empty kettle, he should be on his mettle and yet I'm torn apart,
Bbm7   C    (C/B)   Am7    Am7/G  D       (D7)   D6    D7   G          Am7   Bm7  Am7
Just because I'm presumin' that I could be kinda human if I only had a heart.

       G              Am7        Bm7        C        G                Am7  Bm7
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle and awful sentimental regarding love and art.
Bbm7   C      (C/B)     Am7      Am7/G   D      (D7)        D6     D7   G          Am7  G  G7
I'd be friends with the sparrows and the boy who shoots the arrows if I only had a heart.

(Bridge:)
        C  C#dim         Bm7-5  E7  Am7    D7          G  Em
Picture me...,   a balcony...,     above a voice sings low:
           F#m7    B7    Em  B+          A7         D
"Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"    I hear a beat.  How sweet!

D7      G         Am7      Bm7           C            G               Am7   Bm7
Just to register emotion: "jealousy", "devotion", and really feel the part.
Bbm7    C   (C/B)      Am7     Am7/G   D      (D7)    D6     D7   G          Am7   Bm7  Am7  G
I could stay young and chipper and I'd lock it with a zipper if I only had a heart.


("If I Only Had The Nerve", Cowardly Lion verse:)
D7         G               Am7                Bm7          C          G               Am7   Bm7
Yeah, it's sad, believe me missy, when you're born to be a sissy, without the vim and verve.
Bbm7  C    (C/B)    Am7      Am7/G  D   (D7)   D6      D7   G            Am7   Bm7  Am7
But I could show my prowess, be a   lion not a mowess, if I only had the nerve.

     G                Am7         Bm7         C      G              Am7   Bm7
I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandelion a fate I don't deserve.
Bbm7   C    (C/B) Am7
I'd be brave as a blizzard...
         Am7/G  D     (D7)  D6
TIN MAN: I'd be gentle as a lizard...
           D7     Em
SCARECROW: I'd be clever as a gizzard...
                ?           ?               G
DOROTHY: If the Wizard is a wizard who will serve.
SCARECROW: Then I'm sure to get a brain,   TIN MAN: a heart,   DOROTHY: a home,   LION: da nerve.
