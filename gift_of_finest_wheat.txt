D           Bm       Em/G      D/F#
As when the shepherd calls his sheep,
F#m  G        A        Bm
They know and heed his voice;
   G/D                A/C#   Asus4
So when You call Your family Lord,
A  Em     G     Asus4  A
we follow and rejoice.

Refrain:
D   Bm          G          Bm     Em/B    F#m    Dsus4  D
You satisfy the hungry heart with gift of finest wheat;
A    Bm          Em/G F#m       (Bm)   Em       A       D
Come give to us, O    saving Lord, the bread of life to eat.

D           Bm      Em/G    D/F#
With joyful lips we sing to You,
F#m  G          A    Bm
Our  praise and gratitude,
     G/D                 A/C#   Asus4
That You should count us worthy Lord,
A  Em         G        Asus4  A
To share this heavenly food.

           Bm       Em/G      D/F#
Is not the cup we bless and share,
F#m  G        A         Bm
The  blood of Christ outpoured?
   G/D              A/C#   Asus4
Do not one cup, one loaf declare
A   Em      G      Asus4  A
Our oneness in the Lord?

Refrain:
D   Bm          G          Bm     Em/B    F#m    Dsus4  D
You satisfy the hungry heart with gift of finest wheat;
A    Bm          Em/G F#m       (Bm)   Em       A       D
Come give to us, O    saving Lord, the bread of life to eat.

D           Bm      Em/G     D/F#
The mystery of Your presence Lord,
F#m  G      A          Bm
No   mortal tongue can tell;
     G/D              A/C#   Asus4
Whom all the world cannot contain
A     Em     G         Asus4  A
Comes in our hearts to dwell.

             Bm      Em/G  D/F#
You give Yourself to us O  Lord,
F#m  G        A      Bm
Then selfless let us be,
   G/D              A/C#    Asus4
To serve each other in Your name
A  Em        G    Asus4  A
In truth and charity.

Refrain:
D   Bm          G          Bm     Em/B    F#m    Dsus4  D
You satisfy the hungry heart with gift of finest wheat;
A    Bm          Em/G F#m       (Bm)   Em       A       D
Come give to us, O    saving Lord, the bread of life to eat. (Repeat last line)
