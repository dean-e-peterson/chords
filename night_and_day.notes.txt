Night and Day
 - by Cole Porter
 - Wikipedia mentions it in Bb?  Sheet music samples in Eb but first notes Bb
 - needs work, chords and shortening

Wikpedia, Bb "Night And Day" has unusual chord changes (the underlying
harmony).

The tune begins with a pedal (repeated) dominant with a major seventh chord
built on the flattened sixth of the key, which then resolves to the dominant
seventh in the next bar. If performed in the key of Bb, the first chord is
therefore Gb major seventh, with an F (the major seventh above the harmonic
root) in the melody, before resolving to F7 and eventually Bb maj7.

[Gbmaj7 (...?)  F7  Bbmaj7]

This section repeats and is followed by a descending harmonic sequence starting
with a -7b5 (half diminished or Ø) built on the augmented fourth of the key,
and descending by semitones - with changes in the chord quality- to the
supertonic minor seventh which forms the beginning of a more standard II-V-I
progression. In Bb, this sequence begins with an EØ, followed by an Eb-7, D-7
and Db dim, before resolving onto C-7 (the supertonic minor seventh) and
cadencing onto Bb.

[Em7b5 (half diminished), Ebm7 Dm7 Dbdim Cm7 (F?) Bb]

Em7b5   (x78787)
Ebm7    (x68676)
Dm7     (x57565)
C#dim   (xx5656) or (xx2323)
Cm7     (x35343)

The bridge is also unusual, with an immediate, fleeting and often (depending on
the version) unprepared key change up a minor third, before an equally
transient and unexpected return to the key centre. In Bb, the bridge begins
with a Db major seventh, then moves back to Bb with a Bb major seventh chord.
This repeats, and is followed by a recapitulation of the second section
outlined above.

[Dbmaj7  Bbmaj7  (2x)  then  Em7b5 etc]

The vocal verse is also unusual in that most of the melody consists entirely of
a single note - the same dominant pedal that begins the body of the song - with
rather inconclusive and unusual harmonies underneath.

Some have seen the use of repeated notes in the verse as an indication of the
singer's obsession.
