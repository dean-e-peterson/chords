The Minstrel Boy
 - by Thomas Moore, tenor range G2-C4(D4) in C

C6      (x32210) or (x02213)

(G) C                       Em Am
The minstrel boy to the war is gone,
Em     F        C             G    C      (<--second line simplified chords)
Em     F     C  Am   (Am7)    Dm G C      (<--or C6 or C in place of Am7?)
In the ranks of death ye will find him;

    C                         Em  Am
His father's sword he hath girded on,
Em      F         C        G    C
Em      F    C    Am (Am7) Dm G C
And his wild harp slung  behind him;
 Am      F               D       G
 Am   Em Am    (A2   Am) D  D7   G
"Land of Song!" said the warrior bard,

E     Am            E Am G F
"Tho' all the world betray thee,

    C                           Em    Am
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
Em  F        C          G7     C
Em  F    C   Am (Am7)   Dm  G7 C
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"



(G) C                         Em    Am
The Minstrel fell! But the foeman's chain
Em        F         C          G    C
Em        F     C   Am   (Am7) Dm G C
Could not bring his proud soul un - der;

    C                         Em Am
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
Em     F        C        G    C
Em     F    C   Am (Am7) Dm G C
For he tore its chords a-sun- der;
    Am       F            D       G
                          Dm Dm7  E   (<--alternate line ending tune from choir)
    Am    Em Am   (A2 Am) D  D7   G
And said "No chains shall sully thee,

E    Am           E   Am G F
Thou soul of love and bravery!

    C                            Em  Am
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
           F     C        G7    C
Em         F C   Am (Am7) Dm G7 C
They shall never sound in slavery!"



(Third verse added by unknown author in American Civil War)

The Minstrel Boy will return we pray
When we hear the news we all will cheer it,
The minstrel boy will return one day,
Torn perhaps in body, not in spirit.
Then may he play on his harp in peace,
In a world (such) as heaven intended,
For all the bitterness of man must cease,
And  ev'ry battle must be ended.
