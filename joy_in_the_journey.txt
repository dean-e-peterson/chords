D
There is a joy in the journey,
        A F#m      Bm  F#m         G   A
There's a light we can love on the way.
D             A      (Em) F#m     G
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
                A          D
And freedom for those who obey.

    F#m                         G
And all those who seek it shall find it,
  F#m                  G
A pardon for all who believe,
F#m                                     G  Gmaj7  G6  G  A
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind.

   D
To all who've been born in the Spirit
    A   F#m     Bm F#m         G   A
And who share incarnation with Him,
      D           A    (Em) F#m    G
Who belong to eternity stranded in time,
             A               D
And weary of struggling with sin.

   F#m                       G
Forget not the hope that's before you,
    F#m                     G
And never stop counting the cost,
  F#m                                   G  Gmaj7  G6  G  A
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost.

D
There is a joy in the journey,
        A F#m      Bm  F#m         G   A
There's a light we can love on the way.
D             A      (Em) F#m     G
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
                A          D
And freedom for those who obey.
                A          D
And freedom for those who obey...
