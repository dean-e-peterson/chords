G        Am D          G     Em         Am    D        Gsus4  G
I wish I was in Carrickfergus, only for nights, in Ballygran.
             Am  D            G    Em            Am   D               Gsus4  G
I would swim over the deepest ocean, the deepest ocean for my love to find.

               Em  C                  D              Em Am            Dsus4  D
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over, nor have I   the wings to fly.
           Am     D           G      Em            Am  D               Gsus4  G
If I could find me a handsome boatman, to ferry me over to my love and die.



             Am  D               G          Em         Am   D               Gsus4  G
My childhood days bring back sad reflections, of happy times spent so long ago.
           Am     D             G      Em                Am    D                 Gsus4  G
My boyhood friends and my own relations, have all passed on now like the melting snow.

                  Em  C           D                    Em   Am          Dsus4  D
But I'll spend my days in endless roaming. Soft is the grass, my bed is free.
         Am      D          G     Em             Am       D             Gsus4  G
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus, on that long road down to the salty sea.



          Am   D        G     Em                 Am   D            Gsus4  G
And in Kilkenny it is reported, there are marble stone as black as ink.
              Am    D           G       Em                 Am      D             Gsus4  G
With gold and silver I would support her, but I'll sing no more now till I get a drink,

                Em C               D                 Em   Am            Dsus4  D
For I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober, a handsome rover from town to town.
            Am      D             G       Em               Am       D           Gsus4  G
Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered, so come all ye young men and lay me down.
