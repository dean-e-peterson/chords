Light One Candle
 - by Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul, and Mary), tenor range B2-B3 in G?

Intro: G  Gsus4  G  Gsus4

G
Light one candle for the Maccabee children
                                    Em
With thanks that their light didn't die
C
Light one candle for the pain they endured
           Am                   B7
When their right to exist was denied
Em
Light one candle for the terrible sacrifice
C                     A
Justice and freedom demand
    G
But light one candle for the wisdom to know
         C            D          G B7
When the peacemaker's time is at hand

CHORUS:
E             Am                  D                  G B7
Don't let the light go out!  It's lasted for so many years!
E             Am                    D                              G D G
Don't let the light go out!  Let it shine through our love and our tears.

G
Light one candle for the strength that we need
                        Em
To never become our own foe
    C
And light one candle for those who are suffering
Am                       B7
Pain we learned so long ago
Em
Light one candle for all we believe in
     C                  A
That anger not tear us apart
    G
And light one candle to bind us together
     C            D           G B7
With peace as the song in our hearts

(CHORUS)

G
What is the memory that's valued so highly
                              Em
That we keep it alive in that flame?
C
What's the commitment to those who have died
        Am                          B7
That we cry out they've not died in vain?
Em
We have come this far always believing
     C                        A
That justice would somehow prevail
G
This is the burden, this is the promise
C           D           G B7
This is why we will not fail!

(CHORUS)

E             Am              (3x)   then end on E
Don't let the light go out!
