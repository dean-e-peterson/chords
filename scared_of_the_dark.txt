[Intro]  Am  Em  Am  Dm

[Chorus]
        Am            Em
I'm not scared of the dark
        Am                                      Dm
I'm not running, running, running, no, I'm not afraid of the fall
        Am             Em
I'm not scared, not at all
            Am                    Dm
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
        Am    Em
I'm not scared
        Am                    Dm
I'm not scared, even from the start
   (Em) F             G
I'm not scared of the dark
       Am
Of the dark (mmm) (Tunechi)


[Verse]
Am
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
Em
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
Am
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
Dm
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life"
F
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
G
I mean every word, feelin' like, "Do not disturb," wait
Am
Let me testify, I have never testified
Am
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never, never cried
      Am
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry they sparkle
         Em
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
          Am
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
      Dm
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
     F                                   G
Deep sigh, a sayonara, I ain't afraid to die
                                                            Am
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
                                                       Am
And I'ma shine in the darkness, I look back down at my Rollie, it says, "Time for the chorus", you know


[Chorus]
        Am            Em
I'm not scared of the dark
        Am                                      Dm
I'm not running, running, running, no, I'm not afraid of the fall
        Am             Em
I'm not scared, not at all
            Am                    Dm
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
        Am    Em
I'm not scared
        Am                    Dm
I'm not scared, even from the start
   (Em) F             G
I'm not scared of the dark
       Am
Of the dark (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


[Verse]
      Am
Okay, put my heart to the side, in my feelings, hoe, let's ride
Em
Big MAC to the side, if she call, I'm gon' slide
 Am
"That my baby," boy, you crazy, she might get a new Mercedes
Dm
She say she want me, oowee, okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, uh-huh


[Bridge]
                      F                                    G
If only you count the tears I've cried, a million times, I swear I've died
                     Am
I'm trying, but it's still not right, the only time I want her is night


[Chorus]
        Am            Em
I'm not scared of the dark
        Am                                      Dm
I'm not running, running, running, no, I'm not afraid of the fall
        Am             Em
I'm not scared, not at all
            Am                    Dm
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
        Am    Em
I'm not scared
        Am                    Dm
I'm not scared, even from the start
   (Em) F             G
I'm not scared of the dark
       Am                             Am
Of the dark (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
