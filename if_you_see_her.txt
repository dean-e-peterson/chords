C/B?    (x22010)

Intro: A G A G D  A G A G D (with A on the 5th fret, G on the 3rd)

D              G      D       G        A     D     (Dsus2 D)
If you see her say hello, she might be in Tangiers.
                   G     D          G      Em      C   (C/B) A
She left here last early spring, is living there I hear.
Bm              G     D                                G
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow.
          Bm                 A
She might think that I've forgotten her;
G                       D
Don't tell her it isn't so.

D        G       D   G            A     D     (Dsus2 D)
We had a falling out, like lovers often will,
                        G         D         G            Em   C   (C/B) A
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill.
Bm                 G     D                      G
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Bm                A
She still lives inside of me,
      G           D
We've never been apart.

D          G        D   G         A        D     (Dsus2 D)
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me.
                G       D        G              Em             C   (C/B) A
I always have respected her, for doing what she did and gettin free.
Bm                 G    D                      G
Whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way,
         Bm                 A
Tho' the bitter taste still lingers on
         G                         D
From the night I tried to make her stay.

D              G  D   G     A        D     (Dsus2 D)
I see a lot of people, as I make the rounds,
                    G        D          G       Em      C   (C/B) A
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town,
         Bm           G         D                              G
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off.
Bm            A
Maybe I'm too sensitive,
   G               D
Or else I'm gettin soft.

D       G       D    G    A        D     (Dsus2 D)
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past.
             G        D         G        Em    C   (C/B) A
I know every scene by heart, it all went by so fast.
Bm               G         D                         G
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find;
Bm              A
Tell her she can look me up
G                D
If she's got the time.

Finale: A G A G D  A G A G D (with A on the 5th fret, G on the 3rd)
