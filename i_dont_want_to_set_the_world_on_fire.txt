I just want to be the one you love.

Spoken Word Interlude:
I don't wanna set the world on fire, honey
I love ya too much
I just wanna start a great big flame
Down in your heart
You see, way down inside of me
Darlin' I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know nobody else ain't gonna do
