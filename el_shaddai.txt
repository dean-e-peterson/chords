Chorus:
       Em          A         D         G
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El-Elyon na Adonia,
       C                    F#/E         Bm           B     
Age to age You're still the same, by the power of the name. 
     Em           A          D        G    
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, Erkamka na Adonai, 
        C                   A            D      
We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai. 


             Em                   A
Through your love and through the ram,
              D          G
You saved the son of Abraham;
            C             F#/E
Through the power of your hand,
           Bm           B
Turned the sea into dry land.
       Em             A
To the outcast on her knees,
             D              G
You were the God who really sees,
    C 
And by Your might,
    A                 D
You set Your children free.


(Chorus)

            Em                   A
Through the years You've made it clear,
         D                  G
That the time of Christ was near,
           C               F#/E
Though the people couldn't see
        Bm            B
What Messiah ought to be.
            Em                 A
Though Your Word contained the plan,
          D              G
They just could not understand
          Em (C?)          A
Your most awesome work was done
            Em (C?)         A
Through the frailty of Your Son.


(Chorus 2x)
