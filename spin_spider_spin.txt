     Dm              Gm       Am            Dm
When I went out this morning, spin, spider, spin,
Dm                  Gm       Am            Dm  (C)
Just as the day was dawning, spin, spider, spin,
  F          C (F)      (C)           A7
I saw a tiny spider, his pretty web begin,
  Dm                   Gm             Am            Dm
I saw him swing from a silver string, spin, spider, spin.


CHORUS:
Dm           Gm     Am            Dm
La la la la, la la, spin, spider, spin,
Dm              Gm           Am            Dm  (C)
La la la la la, la la la la, spin, spider, spin,
F               C    (F)    (C)          A7
La la la la la, la la la, la la la la la la,
   Dm              Gm        Am            Dm
La la la la, la la la la la, spin, spider, spin.


     Dm               Gm       Am            Dm
When I came home this evening, spin, spider, spin,
Dm                  Gm       Am            Dm  (C)
Just as the sun was leaving, spin, spider, spin,
  F            C (F)      (C)             A7
I saw the tiny spider, his pretty web all done,
  Dm                   Gm             Am                 Dm
I saw him swing from a silver string, before the setting sun.


(CHORUS)


     Dm                Gm         Am            Dm
He’s not the kind that bites you, spin, spider, spin,
         Dm               Gm          Am            Dm  (C)
He’s the kind that just delights you, spin, spider, spin,
       F             C (F)      (C)                A7
He's a tiny harmless spider, the kind that catches flies;
   Dm                 Gm               Am              Dm
So let him swing on a silver string, a pleasure to the eyes.

OUTRO:
       F             C (F)      (C)                A7

   Dm                 Gm             Am            Dm     Dsus2  Dm
So let him swing on a silver string, spin, spider, spin.
