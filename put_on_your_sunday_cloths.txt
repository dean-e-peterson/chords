    Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers,                                      Cmaj7 (x32000)
                              Dmaj7                         C6               D7         Gmaj7 (320002)
    Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby, there's a slick town, Barnaby.        Fmaj7 (xx3210)
    Gmaj7    Fmaj7                       Gmaj7  Fmaj7                                   Dm7   (xx0211)
    Out there, full of shine and full of sparkle,                                       C6    (x02213)
                               Gmaj7              Dm7          G7   C                   Gm7   (353333)
    Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby.  Listen, Barnaby.                      A7+5  (x03021)
                                                                                        Fm6   (xx0111)

    Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there,                        G9    (320201)
    C                   C6              Gm7
    Get out the brilliantine and dime cigars.
    C                                         Am
    We're gonna find adventure in the evening air.
    Em                   F                         Em                       Dm7 G7
    Girls in white, in a perfumed night, where the lights are bright as the stars.

    C                                                    Cmaj7
    Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
    C                   C6               Em7 A7+5 A7
    In one of those new horse-drawn open cars.
          Dm                  E7                 Am                  D7 Fm6
    We'll see the shows at Delmonico's and we'll close the town in a whirl,
           C          C+     Dm7       G9       C
    And we won't come home until we've kissed a girl.

C                                                 Cmaj7
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out,
C                         C6                Gm7
Strut down the street and have your picture took.
C                                               Am
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about.
     Em                F                     Em                  Dm7 G7
That Sunday shine is a certain sign that you feel as fine as you look.

C                                        Cmaj7
Beneath your parasol, the world is all a smile,
C                         C6               Em7 A7+5 A7
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes.
    Dm                      E7                    Am                    D7 Fm6
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers, your beads and buckles and bows,
            C       C+     Dm7     G9
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday...
    C  C+     Dm7     G9           C  C+     Dm7     G9     C
    No Monday in your Sunday...    No Monday in your Sunday clothes.

    (Repeat from last "Put on your Sunday clothes", through parasol, without repeating "No Monday"'s")

C                                                 Cmaj7
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out,
C                         C6                Gm7
Strut down the street and have your picture took.
C                                               Am
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about.
     Em                F                     Em                  Dm7 G7
That Sunday shine is a certain sign that you feel as fine as you look.

C                                             Cmaj7
Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song,
C                  C6                  Em7 A7+5 A7
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose.
    Dm                      E7                     Am                 D7 Fm6
Get out your slickers, your flannel knickers, your red suspenders and hose,
            C         C+        Am         D7
In your new straw hat, and your silk cravat,                   <- These 2 lines are the ending from
D7          Dm7            G9             C                       Hal Leonard's Broadway Fake Book,
There'll be no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes.             <- but the movie scene omitted them
                C       C+     Dm7     G9     C                   ...
    For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes.         <- and continued with this line,
                                                                  followed by talking & all aboard's.
    Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there,
    Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes.
    We're gonna find adventure in the evening air.
    To town we'll trot to a smoky spot where the girls are hot as a fuse, Wow!

    Put on your silk high hat and at the turned up cuff,
    We'll wear a hand made gray suede buttoned glove.  (We wanna take New York by Storm!)
    We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's, and this I'm positive of,
    Fm6     C               C+     Am             D7      Dm7               G9             C
    That we won't come home, no we won't come home, No we won't come home until we fall in love.
